AI Model: gemini-2.5-flash
Li Bufan looked at everyone, unsure of their thoughts regarding his invitation.

Li Bufan knew clearly that he was helping them, offering them a chance at wealth.

If they were truly willing to trust him and work hard with him, it wouldn't be impossible for each of them to become billionaires in the future.

At this moment, the three of them looked a bit lost, seemingly finding Li Bufan's proposal to start a company quite unbelievable.

Just then, Wang Huadong was the first to express his stance: "Brother, I'm willing to work with you. Although I don't know your professional programming, I can help with odd jobs and other tasks. If there are any miscellaneous or tiring jobs, you can call me over, and I'll handle it. I don't need any shares or dividends. I don't need a high salary either, 3000 per month is enough for daily expenses."

Li Bufan was very satisfied with Wang Huadong's performance and secretly planned that perhaps he could train him well in the future. As long as he was loyal, he would be given a chance at wealth.

At this point, Lü Danhao spoke with a hint of apology: "Brother, I'm sorry. As you know, my major really can't do much for you. Besides, my parents are counting on me to go back and inherit the family business, helping them manage the company."

"However, don't worry. If you encounter any difficulties in starting your business, you can tell me. For example, if there's insufficient initial capital, I can discuss it with my parents and have them invest in your project. I won't ask for a high percentage of shares. I'll ask for some money from home and invest 1 million, only taking a 10% share."

Li Bufan secretly shook his head, thinking his words were too outrageous. He planned to earn 10 billion us dollars with this company, and here he was, planning to get something for nothing. A 10% share would be at least several billion us dollars, a profit of tens of thousands of times in a Change of hands. He truly lived up to being a capitalist, quite impressive.

But Li Bufan didn't object to him for the time being, because Li Bufan wanted to hear Bu Changzhuo's opinion first.

Li Bufan looked at Bu Changzhuo, whose facial expression was rich, as if he had gone through a struggle and finally made up his mind, saying: "Our relationship as brothers goes without saying. I can work for you for free, and we'll start a business together. Our brothers are of one heart, working together to overcome difficulties. As you said about the shares, I can do without them."

"But when the company becomes a Fortune 500 company in the future, don't forget my one percent dividend, hahaha. As for salary and such, everyone is short on money right now, so I won't ask for it for now. I still have some spare money, enough to spend. After the company becomes profitable in the future, we can pay salaries and bonuses according to market conditions."

Li Bufan was very satisfied with this, feeling that Bu Changzhuo's emotional intelligence was indeed very high, truly deserving of being called the "Love Saint" by the class. Li Bufan felt that Bu Changzhuo seemed to have the potential to be a company CEO and was very pleased with this.

Li Bufan looked at everyone and slowly said: "First of all, thank you Wang Huadong and Bu Changzhuo for your help. The company needs you. We can discuss the specifics of the company later. Secondly, thank you Lü Danhao for your generosity. However, since it's a software company, we don't need too much capital in the initial stage, a few tens of thousands will be enough, and the returns will be quick, so we don't need investment."

Hearing Li Bufan's expression, Lü Danhao felt that this seemed to be a profitable project, otherwise, why would Li Bufan be unwilling to accept a 10 million valuation when the company hadn't even been established yet? So he asked: "Old Li, tell us properly, what kind of project are you actually going to do?"

At this time, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong nodded upon hearing this, seemingly in agreement.

Seeing this, Li Bufan had no choice but to say: "The project is like this. As everyone knows, in the social networking field, Twitter and Facebook are in a standoff internationally, while Micro-Speech is dominant in China. Have you ever thought about why not many people outside of China use Micro-Speech, even if it's truly excellent? And why don't people in China choose Facebook?"

Bu Changzhuo seemed to have a good understanding of this and said: "I know this. First, it's a publicity issue. Many people outside of China haven't heard of Micro-Speech. Second, it's a language issue. Many functions of Micro-Speech are only available in the Chinese version, and the English translation still has some flaws in some places, making it unsuitable for foreign users.

As for Facebook users in China, the first is the Great Firewall of the internet, which is an irresistible force. Second, it's still a language issue. After all, it doesn't have a Chinese version, and even if it did, the posts published by those users are in various languages, making them completely incomprehensible."

Li Bufan strongly agreed with Bu Changzhuo's analysis and said: "That's right, the biggest reason is the language issue. That is, the problem caused by users in different countries not being able to communicate in language.

Have you ever considered a possibility? If there was a platform where you could speak in your own country's language, and others could see it in their country's language;

Similarly, if others post in English, Spanish, Russian, etc., and you see it in Chinese, then you can chat and become sworn brothers with them.

If such a platform existed, its influence and user activity would be unimaginable, and it might even monopolize the entire social platform."

Bu Changzhuo thought for a moment and said: "If you put it that way, it is indeed the case. However, the premise for this to happen is that your translation must be accurate.

For example, the translation for 'Slip carefully' (caution wet floor) on many translation platforms is 'Slip Carefully'. It's quite funny, a big blunder, isn't it?

Because language is polysemous, and different contexts vary, it's not fixed and unique. This also leads to machines having difficulty understanding ambiguous language, and the translation results are very poor."

Seeing that Bu Changzhuo was completely following his rhythm, Li Bufan was very satisfied and couldn't help but give a thumbs-up with his right hand, saying: "Good, very good. This is indeed a current problem.

But it is precisely because there are problems that there is a market with incredibly broad prospects, isn't it? Think about it, Facebook's market valuation is close to 500 billion us dollars.

If we can create a more perfect platform, perhaps a trillion-dollar market value is just around the corner, hahaha."

At this time, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong were very satisfied upon hearing Li Bufan's ambitious words, thinking about the future prospects of the company. Their hearts were filled with excitement, passion, and drive.

Meanwhile, Lü Danhao was muttering softly to the side: "Damn, he even said the funds were sufficient and he wouldn't accept my investment. It turns out he looks down on my money. Tsk tsk tsk, I didn't expect Xiao Li to have such big ambitions. Alas, don't look at how big a pie he's drawing, it's probably impossible to achieve.

He hasn't even started a company, unlike our family, which runs a company. I often know the hardships of running a company.

Alas, as a roommate, it's not good to laugh at him. When he's been smoothed out by society in the future, he'll probably come begging me for investment, hehe."

Li Bufan saw the longing looks on Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong's faces and felt that the people's will was on his side and they could work hard.

However, Li Bufan noticed that Lü Danhao was smirking to the side, as if mocking Li Bufan's ignorance and arrogance.

Li Bufan couldn't help but sneer in his heart: "Heh heh, I originally wanted to give you a chance at wealth based on our good relationship as roommates for a few years, but I didn't expect such disdain. Fine, anyway, we've already graduated. Don't come begging me then."

At this time, Li Bufan pulled Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong outside, wanting to talk to them properly about future matters.

In the Jiahhao coffee shop on campus, Li Bufan sat on one side of the table, while Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong sat on the other side. In front of the three of them were cappuccinos that Li Bufan had ordered.

Li Bufan said to the two of them: "I know you're willing to start a business with me entirely because our relationship is strong. I'm very happy about this, very happy to have two such good brothers.

In the future, if I have something to eat, I'll make sure you also have something to eat. We'll share both good times and bad.

How about we three here become sworn brothers like in the Peach Garden Oath? We don't seek to be born on the same day and month, but we seek to die on the same day and month."

Then, Li Bufan drank his coffee while looking at the two people opposite him. The two thought for a moment, looked at each other, nodded, and said one after another: "

That's excellent! Should we three brothers divide into an Elder Brother, Second Brother, and Third Brother?"

"Haha, since we plan to become sworn brothers, let's go by age. I'm the youngest, so I'll be the Third Brother?" Li Bufan looked at the two.

Bu Changzhuo seemed to have thought of something, so he shook his head and said: "We can't calculate it that way.

The capable come first, and besides, you usually guide us in our studies. And in the future, we two will rely on Brother and work for Brother!"

Then Wang Huadong also nodded in agreement, stood up, cupped his hands to Li Bufan and Bu Changzhuo respectively, and said: "My ability is relatively the worst, so I'll just be the Third Brother.

Third Brother greets Elder Brother and Second Brother here. Third Brother is naturally slow-witted, and in the future, I will need Elder Brother and Second Brother to teach me how to conduct myself."

Li Bufan nodded and said: "Haha, since my brothers think so highly of me, I will humbly accept.

Since I've become the Elder Brother, I'll also give you a heads-up. I am confident I can complete the first product within three days. A long time ago, I started researching NLP (Natural Language Processing) and AI (Artificial Intelligence).

Rest assured, within three days, I will have our company's first product ready and demonstrate it to you. By then, you will know the power of this software.

Of course, even among close brothers, accounts must be settled clearly. I said I would give you one percent of the shares and dividends, and I will definitely keep my word.

Our three brothers will all become billionaires in the future. Follow me, and you won't suffer."

Hearing this, the two were very happy.

After a moment, everyone's expressions returned to normal. Li Bufan said: "These two days, my main job is to complete the product development.

Next, there are many more things to be busy with. Everyone take out paper and pens to take notes."

With that, Li Bufan took out paper and pens from his backpack and handed them to the two people opposite him.

Li Bufan's expression was serious, and he said in a deep voice: "Next, we need to do the following things.

Today, we still have the entire afternoon, and tomorrow we have the entire day. The things you need to do are as follows."

"First, we have graduated and can no longer live on campus. Therefore, I plan to rent a place outside. We can rent a three-person room, or we can rent three adjacent single rooms.

Either is fine with me, it's up to you. Afterwards, I will transfer 50,000 to Bu Changzhuo to cover the rental cost."

"Second, we need to register a company. Since we are mainly a software company, I have already thought of the name: Zhi Gao Software, abbreviated as 3S in English.

A registered capital of 50,000 will be fine, as the Administration for Industry and Commerce requires a minimum registered capital of 30,000 for registration.

For this item, I will transfer another 50,000 to Bu Changzhuo.

Of course, when registering the company, you must not forget to seek help from the teachers at the university's entrepreneurship college.

Because, as college students starting a business, there are preferential policies, generally speaking, there is a tax reduction policy for the first three years. You must strive to get this, it is very important."

"Third, find an office location. Initially, we can register the company in the university's entrepreneurship park, which makes registration more convenient.

But when we actually work, we still need to find another office building, which needs to have meeting rooms and office space for at least 100 people.

It's best to rent an entire floor. Although this will be more expensive, generally speaking, a floor will be about 3000 square meters, and the monthly rent per square meter is around 20 yuan. That means renting a floor is about 60,000 yuan. We'll sign a half-year lease first, which is 360,000 yuan.

Adding some office supplies and servers, the initial investment is approximately 1 million yuan.

This office only needs to be found and booked tomorrow, item procurement completed the day after tomorrow, and basic renovation completed the day after that.

Eco-friendly paint should be used for renovation materials. Don't be afraid to spend money, just make it as fast as possible.

This 1 million yuan will be transferred to the company account after the company account is set up."

"Fourth, employee recruitment. On this point, let me explain what kind of company we will be.

First of all, Zhi Gao Software is a software company that utilizes high technology, so most of the office staff will be programmers.

Their main job is to do secondary development based on the software and API interfaces I provide.

Of course, as a complete company, departments like Finance, Legal, and Human Resources are also needed.

Regarding recruitment, Bu Changzhuo, you are familiar with software business. While you are busy registering the company, also help out with this. Wang Huadong alone probably can't handle it.

Initially, we will need about 20 programmers, 2 product managers, 5 graphic designers, 3 new media platform operators, 5 marketing specialists, 5 legal advisors, 4 accountants, 2 HR, 3 secretaries, 5 security guards, 2 cleaning ladies, and 2 cooking ladies.

The minimum salary for these people is 5000 per month, and for technical positions, the minimum is 10000 per month, with the current maximum being 20000 per month.

Regarding salaries, I will inject a total of 5 million yuan into the company account, so you don't have to worry about not being able to pay salaries."

"Fifth, regarding our three positions.

As the Chairman and Head of the Technical Department, I will mainly be in the Chairman's office and will not be responsible for daily affairs, unless the CEO cannot solve them or they involve important matters, then I will handle them.

I will delegate authority to the CEO. Bu Changzhuo, how do you feel about the position of CEO? I think highly of you. You are smooth in handling matters, so there should be no problem.

As for Wang Huadong, I know you are usually a bit slow-witted and have some problems communicating with others. However, as our good brother, you cannot always live in your own world. You also need to become confident, hold your head high, puff out your chest, walk with vigor and spirit, be generous, and neither humble nor arrogant.

Regarding your position, I have thought about it. You can't change all at once, so you will be the Head of the Secretariat. Your main responsibility is to convey the orders that I and Bu Changzhuo issue to the company.

If you cannot complete some of these orders alone, don't forget the other three people in your Secretariat; you can act together.

Hehe, the secretaries are all girls! Seize the opportunity! While improving your interpersonal communication skills, you can seize the opportunity. Our company does not prohibit relationships between superiors and subordinates, you know."

At this time, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong nodded frantically, very satisfied with Li Bufan's decision.

Seeing this, Li Bufan was very happy. He stood up and extended his right hand forward, palm facing down, signaling to the two with his eyes.

The two placed their hands one by one like stacking blocks, and then forcefully swung them down, indicating the achievement of the three-party agreement.

Li Bufan looked at the two and laughed happily.

"Haha, our three brothers together, with one heart and one mind, will work together to overcome difficulties! Let's go!"
