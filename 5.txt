AI Model: gemini-2.5-flash
That evening, Li Bufan left the quantum computer in his rented room, locked the door, and returned to the house Bu Changzhuo had rented.

At this time, the items in the three rooms were neatly arranged. Li Bufan saw that all the things he had packed in the dormitory before were already in the room, and he was very satisfied.

Li Bufan opened these large and small bags of luggage and checked them one by one, finding that nothing was missing.

Then he called Wang Huadong to help him make the bed. After that, he took out the necessary items for the room, such as stationery, paper, a desk lamp, a laptop, and other things.

Half an hour later, the room was tidied up. Li Bufan came out and saw Bu Changzhuo browsing the web on the computer, with the interface split in two.

One side was checking office building listings on 58 Tongcheng, and the other was posting paid job advertisements on major recruitment websites.

At this time, Wang Huadong was playing on his phone, distracted.

Seeing this, Li Bufan walked over, patted Wang Huadong's shoulder, and said, "Third Brother, it's getting late now, and everyone hasn't eaten yet, right?"

Order takeout on your phone, just the KFC triple meal. Order whatever you want to eat. You know what Bu Changzhuo and I usually like to eat. I'll reimburse you after you order."

Wang Huadong nodded upon hearing this, rubbed his belly, and expressed his strong agreement.

Li Bufan walked up to Bu Changzhuo and asked, "Second Brother, how is the progress now?"

After hearing Li Bufan's words, Bu Changzhuo put down his work, turned around, and said to Li Bufan:

"Brother, this afternoon I went to find the teacher at our entrepreneurship college. The teacher said that the materials are complete and we should be able to get the business license the day after tomorrow."

Also, regarding the policy on entrepreneurship discount for college students, the local area offers tax exemption in the first year and half tax in the following two years."

Li Bufan nodded, expressing satisfaction.

"I see you are busy with recruitment and finding an office location. How is the progress now?"

Bu Changzhuo slowly said, "Regarding the recruitment website, I have submitted the relevant information about the job requirements and paid a deposit of 3000 yuan to the website."

Also, regarding the office space, I have a few places I like. Come and help me take a look."

"Harbor Building, a famous high-end office building, with a total of 88 floors. Currently, floors 13, 17, 38, and 72 are not leased or sold. It's 8 kilometers away from where we live."

Each floor has over 5000 square meters of space, enough for nearly 300 people to work, and has a series of office facilities including conference rooms. However, the price is a bit expensive, with a monthly rent of 120,000."

"The office building in the Science and Technology Park is very close to us, only a 5-minute walk away. There is a 6-story office building there that they want to rent or sell as a whole. The total area is 16,000 square meters, which can accommodate nearly 1000 people for work, and has a series of supporting facilities including a gym."

I asked, and it's not impossible to rent a single floor, which would cost about 80,000 a month. If rented as a whole, it would cost 300,000 a month."

"A building in the Binhai District, that area is relatively remote, 35 kilometers away from us, and it takes about 1 hour by subway and bus."

That building has a total of 18 floors, of which floors 3, 7, and 13 are not yet leased. Each floor is about 3000 square meters, and the rent is about 50,000 a month."

Upon hearing this, Li Bufan felt that the first building was good. It was particularly high-class, which would make the company appear more financially capable.

However, Li Bufan thought that it could only provide office space for 300 people, and his brow furrowed as he thought about the future.

For example, what should be done if the number of employees increases? And the company needs some server rooms as essential items for future operations, which will also take up a lot of space.

At this time, Li Bufan realized that the 200-person office space he had previously thought of was likely not enough, and the larger the area, the better.

From this perspective, Li Bufan was very fond of the second building. Li Bufan saw the exterior of the building displayed in Bu Changzhuo's browser and felt it was decent, thinking it was acceptable.

Although the rent was a bit expensive, the initial funds could be exchanged for cash using system points. After all, 1 point could be exchanged for 10,000 US dollars, so the initial investment was sufficient.

So, Li Bufan said to Bu Changzhuo, "How about this, you contact the landlord of the office building in the university science park closest to us."

See if he can allow us to view the office space tomorrow. If we are satisfied, we will sign the lease contract later."

Bu Changzhuo nodded in agreement and, according to Li Bufan's instructions, walked to the balcony and started calling to inquire.

After a moment, Bu Changzhuo said, "No problem, that landlord is also generous. He said he will open it to us around 10 am tomorrow. We can just contact the front desk then."

Li Bufan nodded upon hearing this.

At this time, the takeout had arrived, and everyone put down their work, went to the bathroom to wash their hands, opened the KFC packaging, and ate heartily while chatting and laughing.

......

The next morning, the sun was bright. Li Bufan asked Bu Changzhuo for the contact information and went to inspect the building with Wang Huadong.

Meanwhile, Bu Changzhuo sat in front of his computer, staring at the email information on the recruitment website, ready to contact some applicants.

10 minutes later, Li Bufan found the office building. Its appearance was simple but concise and elegant, which was quite satisfactory.

Upon entering the entrance, they were stopped by the security guard.

"We have an appointment with Boss Huang by phone. We agreed to come and see the office building at 10 o'clock today."

The security guard heard that they had an appointment with his Boss, so he let the two of them pass.

Walking into the building, Li Bufan saw that the decoration was elegant, with flowers and plants adorning it.

At this time, a building receptionist looked at Li Bufan and the other person and felt a little unbelievable.

The Boss had said that the person coming to see the office building today might be a rich second-generation young master and that she should take good care of him.

Unexpectedly, she encountered two poor young men dressed simply, with their clothes totaling less than a thousand yuan, which made her very disappointed.

But she did not dare to disobey the Boss's instructions, so she could only start introducing the building to Li Bufan.

"Hello, Mr.. I am Li Wenjing. The Boss asked me to come and receive you two today. I will briefly introduce the environment of the entire office building."

"First, the building has a total of 6 floors. The first floor has public facilities such as conference rooms, reception rooms, monitoring rooms, and a gym, and no separate office space is set up."

"From the second to the fifth floor, each floor has 30 independent offices, 150-200 sets of desks and chairs, 1 kitchen, 2 restrooms, 2 conference rooms, and 1 large storage room. You can convert the storage room into a server room or other uses."

"The sixth floor is all independent offices. However, the sixth floor is more luxuriously decorated, with 15 independent offices and 1 medium-sized conference room."

It is more suitable for high-level executives such as the Chairman, CEO, and managers."

"Secondly, the entire building currently has over 1200 sets of desks and chairs, and each office has various office furniture."

Of course, if you have any additional needs, you can contact us or purchase them yourself."

Afterward, in the contract, we will specify our office equipment.

If you plan to lease, it is recommended not to damage it, otherwise, you will need to compensate according to the price after the lease ends.

Of course, if you plan to purchase the entire building, that's another matter."

"Finally, let's talk about the overall environment of the building. The building is finely decorated."

If a company moves in, there is no need to change too many things, just purchase electrical facilities such as computers, servers, and routers.

The building has two elevators for going up and down. Then we will give you about 100 parking tickets for the science park. With these, you can park for free underground."

"Well, that's about it. For the rest, I can take you on a tour and answer your questions."

Upon hearing this, Li Bufan felt it was very suitable for him, because the various facilities were basically complete. In this way, it was actually normal for the rent to be a bit expensive.

Just like that, the group of three walked around, pointing out various aspects of the building. Finally, they finalized it, and Li Bufan said:

"Sister, we are very grateful for your hard work in showing us around the entire building today."

Regarding the signing of the lease contract, I will contact your Boss as soon as I get the business license.

I can pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan first. I guarantee that we will sign the lease contract within three days. Do you think this is feasible?

I will wait here. You can contact your Boss on the side.

By the way, my contact information is 186****7694, my surname is Li."

After speaking, the receptionist reported what had just happened to her Boss, specifically mentioning that they looked like poor students and didn't know if they had the money to lease the building.

However, that far-sighted Boss not only did not refuse but also looked at them with new eyes and was very optimistic, then asked her to hand the phone to Li Bufan.

"Hello, are you Xiao Li? Nice to meet you. My name is Zhang Aiguo, CEO of Dahua Logistics, mainly engaged in logistics management."

I heard you want to postpone the lease of this building for three days? It's okay, you don't need to pay a deposit. I trust you on this.

I heard you just started your business not long ago. If you need any support in the future, you can contact me. By the way, my personal number is 189****4997.

Alright, that's it. When you plan to sign the lease contract, I will come in person to discuss it with you and explain the experience of predecessors. I hope it will be useful to you."

"Yes, yes. Okay, right, yes. Thank you. Okay, goodbye."

Li Bufan finished talking with Boss Zhang, returned the phone to the receptionist, and left.

At this time, Li Bufan and Wang Huadong returned home and saw Bu Changzhuo still at the computer desk, with many chat windows in front of him, with both men and women.

Li Bufan looked closely and found that he was discussing some basic situations with applicants.

Li Bufan patted Bu Changzhuo's shoulder, "Brother, why are you still sitting here? You haven't moved for a long time? You've worked hard! Have you had lunch?"

Bu Changzhuo shook his head and said, "Alas, I've been busy talking with applicants all morning. They are worried about the prospects of our Zhi Gao Software Company."

Many people canceled their resume submissions when they learned that we are just a startup company.

Alas, these people are all so snobbish. Can't they have some ambition and vitality?

By the way, I haven't had lunch yet. What about you? Was your morning smooth?"

"Haha, for those who don't want to join our company, make a blacklist.

Later, when our company becomes popular, don't hire them either.

Let them see that they ignored us back then, and by then, they won't be able to climb high.

I guessed you hadn't eaten yet, so we came back directly.

Wang Huadong, order some takeout, two meat and two vegetable dishes and a soup, from the restaurant we usually eat at. I'll reimburse you later.

Regarding checking out that office building this morning, we are both very satisfied because the facilities there are complete, and many things can be used directly.

And the Boss is also very nice. I told them that we will sign the lease contract with them when our business license is issued."

Then, Li Bufan also asked, "By the way, among the people you contacted, how many want to join our company at the moment?

For those people, do you plan to interview them yourself? Or what method will you use for recruitment?"

Bu Changzhuo replied, "Haha, regarding this, it's actually very simple."

I am currently mainly chatting with those who want to apply for HR positions first to see their own willingness.

Then I will screen a batch based on their quality, character, and relevant industry knowledge, and then interview them one by one, finally keeping a certain number of HRs.

Finally, the recruitment work will be handed over to them and let them start recruiting. As for those in the Technical Department, I suggest you can look at them last. How about that?"

Li Bufan nodded, agreeing strongly with Bu Changzhuo's opinion, and said with a smile, "Haha, you are the CEO now."

I won't interfere with the company's affairs normally. Just feel free to do what you think is right.

As for the members of the Technical Department, as the Chairman and CTO, I still need to do a simple screening at the end. That's it, you can get busy."

"By the way, Wang Huadong, have you ordered the takeout?" Li Bufan looked at the idle Wang Huadong.

Wang Huadong nodded and said, "It's done, totaling 103 yuan."

"Okay, I'll transfer it to you later. Next, I will instruct you on what you need to do during these two days while our business license is not yet out."

"Bu Changzhuo will mainly recruit HR first. After the recruitment is completed, Bu Changzhuo will also purchase items with Wang Huadong."

For purchasing office supplies, it is mainly computers and routers that are missing in some offices and office spaces.

There are also projectors and computers missing in the conference rooms. Wang Huadong, you can think carefully about these office items, after all, you went with me this morning.

Think back and see what is missing, make a list, and then purchase from some large manufacturers, which will be cheaper."

"By the way, there is also a very important matter, we need to customize various signs."

For example, the logo design of our Zhi Gao Software Company, plaque customization, directional signs inside the building, office doorplates for executives such as the Chairman and CEO, etc.

Finally, customize our company uniforms and unified badges for the access control system."

"That's about it. I guess this will keep you busy for a long time, right? I need to see you complete this task within three days. Can you do it?"

After Li Bufan finished speaking, he looked at Wang Huadong and Bu Changzhuo.

The two thought for a moment, then nodded in agreement.
