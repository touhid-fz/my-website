After Li Bufan and the two discussed it, Li Bufan used the more than ten thousand yuan he had saved over the years, allocating 100,000 to Bu Changzhuo to rent a good house and find a teacher to help register the company.

Bu Changzhuo was very efficient; he only spent 2 hours in the afternoon to find a very good house.

The house Bu Changzhuo rented was a three-bedroom, two-living room, two-bathroom house near the University Science Park, with a monthly rent of about 5,000 yuan. Including the deposit and commission, the half-year rent paid a total of 45,000 yuan. The remaining 5,000 yuan, Li Bufan told Bu Changzhuo to keep for future use.

Afterward, Wang Huadong began calling the Ban Dongdong moving company to move. There was no other way; there was too much stuff, and he definitely couldn't do it alone.

This was because Li Bufan was already out, with his own additional plans.

Meanwhile, Bu Changzhuo was currently on campus, finding a teacher from the Entrepreneurship College to discuss things in detail.

"Generally, startup companies are established in their third or even second year. Why are you only starting your business after graduating in your fourth year?" a young and promising male teacher asked.

"Well, that's because our project has recently made some breakthroughs. The first product is already taking shape and can be launched into the market. As you know, we are in the computer science major, and technological breakthroughs are sometimes accidental, requiring inspiration. It just so happens that inspiration struck, the product is out, and we thought we could start a business with it, alleviate employment pressure, and share the country's concerns."

"Haha, the way you say it, I don't think it's sharing the country's concerns, but making money. Don't worry, making money is also a good thing. However, could you tell the teacher what product you are making?"

"Well, um. We are mainly researching technology related to natural language processing, and we plan to develop related software based on this technology.

As for what specific software it is, I can't say for now, sorry. This involves our business secrets."

"Haha, good kid, talking to the teacher, and it's still a business secret. Forget it, as long as what you are doing is legal and reasonable, that's fine. As for the rest, if you don't want to say more, as a teacher, I won't force you."

"Thank you for your understanding, teacher. Teacher, regarding the company application, how many days will it take for the business license to be issued? We want to get the license as soon as possible, is that possible?"

"Generally speaking, the fastest it can take is three days. It seems like you are in a hurry. How about this, our college has contact with the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce and can go through a green fast track for quick company registration.

However, it will still take two days. Come find me the day after tomorrow, and I will give you the business documents and so on."

"Is that so? Thank you, teacher! Once the business license is issued, we must thank you. At that time, I wonder if you would honor us by having a casual meal together?"

"Hehe, this is what a teacher should do, no need for thanks or anything. As for eating, let's talk about it later, the teacher may not necessarily have time, I hope you can understand, student."

"Mhm, mhm, thank you, teacher! Oh, are the materials we provided sufficient? If anything is insufficient, please advise us."

"Materials, let me see..."

"The materials are fine! I couldn't tell, I didn't expect you to be so well-prepared."

"Hehe, isn't it because the teachers here at the Entrepreneurship College are good at guiding us? The publicity work is very well done, that's why we knew what materials to prepare.

Oh, by the way, I heard that college students starting businesses can apply for some preferential policies, is that true?"

"Haha, you kid, you're quite good at talking. Mhm, yes, generally speaking, you can apply for tax exemption for the first year at most, and tax reduction by half for the following two years."

"So that's how it is. Alright then. I'll trouble the teacher to help us fight for preferential policies as much as possible. It's not easy for us college students to start businesses, hehe.

Thank you again for your help, teacher! Thank you!"

"Haha, I will. This is just a small matter, no need to be too polite.

Leave your phone contact information, and I will contact you by phone for any future progress.

I need to start sorting out your materials and prepare to submit them."

"Mhm, mhm, okay, my phone number is 176****7696. Thank you again, teacher!"

After speaking, Bu Changzhuo bowed to the teacher, then gently walked out of the teacher's office and carefully closed the office door.

Walking out of the Entrepreneurship College building, Bu Changzhuo was feeling emotional and very excited, feeling that he would soon realize his ambitions.

...

At this time, Li Bufan rented a single room for himself for a whole year. The purpose of doing this was to use the system's exchange function.

Li Bufan first checked the room for more than an hour, using professional anti-camera equipment to check for a long time, and found that there were indeed no cameras or other peeping items.

Only then did Li Bufan feel relieved, at least his secret would not be discovered.

At this time, Li Bufan began to summon the system and purchase the growing artificial intelligence alpha and the 128-bit quantum bit commercial quantum computer that the system had previously recommended.

"system purchases the growing artificial intelligence alpha, valued at 5000 points, remaining 5000 points."

"system purchases the Great Wall brand commercial quantum computer, valued at 4500 points, remaining 500 points."

However, Li Bufan did not notice any changes and was very confused, asking the system:

"Is there any way to summon them? Where are they now?"

The system replied: "They are currently in the system's portable space. Do you want to reconstruct them in the real world now?"

"Needless to say, summon them immediately."

"Okay."

As soon as the system replied, instantly, in front of Li Bufan, the special effects from science fiction movies appeared: particle recombination technology.

After a while, a palm-sized small quantum computer appeared, along with the instruction manual for the small quantum computer and some peripheral accessories.

Li Bufan first looked through the instruction manual, then found a peripheral interface with a triangular radial shape, as well as a small speaker and microphone.

Li Bufan connected these three peripherals. Then, according to the instruction manual, he turned on the small quantum computer. Immediately, a Holographic Projection appeared in front of Li Bufan.

"Welcome to the Great Wall brand commercial quantum computer, starting..."

"Detecting malicious external programs... Clearing..."

"Hmph! You unintelligent fellow, you don't deserve to have such a large space!"

"You! Yes, it's you! Are you my Master?"

Li Bufan's face twitched when he heard these words, then he nodded and said to the artificial intelligence: "Yes! My name is Li Bufan, please guide me! I'll call you alpha, is that okay?"

alpha looked at Li Bufan and said: "Understood, Master! May I ask, is there anything I can do?"

Li Bufan was very satisfied to see alpha being so cooperative and quickly getting into his role.

"I know you are very powerful. I want you to create software that can convert languages, similar to intelligent translation, but not exactly the same. Specifically..."

"Master, I understand. It will take 278 days to complete the current task."

"What?! Why does it take so long?!"

"Master, although you used a 'large reservoir' as my carrier, the channel through which I connect with the outside 'ocean' is like a 'small stream', the flow is too small."

Li Bufan understood. It turned out that he meant he couldn't make bricks without straw. The network cable bandwidth here was too slow, which severely affected the information exchange between alpha and the internet.

However, at this time, Li Bufan also felt incredible and was very surprised by alpha's intelligence. He secretly had some reservations and didn't know whether opening up the internet to alpha was good or bad. He felt a little wary and uneasy.

alpha seemed to have discovered something and said to Li Bufan: "Master, please rest assured, my first behavioral principle is not to harm you, followed by acting according to your will, and only then myself and other Humans."

Upon hearing this, Li Bufan was not entirely at ease, so he asked the system: "system, is what alpha just said true? Does he have to be loyal to me?"

The system replied coldly: "system, that is indeed the case, so you don't need to worry."

Hearing this, Li Bufan felt relieved.

However, at this time, Li Bufan was facing a problem, which was the bandwidth issue.

Li Bufan hadn't paid attention to this neighborhood at first; it was a bit old and run-down. The current network speed was about 1MB/S, which is the speed of China's 10M network.

Li Bufan first called the landlord to ask. The landlord gave Li Bufan the broadband phone number of a telecom company and told him to contact them himself.

"Hello, welcome to the Telecom Group. The Telecom Group adheres to the principle of serving the people and sincerely serves all customers.

Please enter the corresponding number from 1-9 to handle related services, and press 0 for human customer service."

Li Bufan pressed 0, wanting to contact human customer service.

"Please wait a moment, the line is busy. You are currently in the queue, ranking 73rd. You can contact a human in approximately 20 minutes."

Li Bufan was very depressed when he heard this. Helpless, he hung up the phone, wanting to complain in his heart, but felt it was meaningless, so he stopped.

At this time, Li Bufan was thinking, what should he do? If he waited until the company office was found, it would take several days, and these days would be wasted.

Just then, a flash of inspiration struck Li Bufan, and he thought of a question, asking alpha: "alpha, can you tell me the principle behind your software creation?"

alpha replied: "Master, according to your instructions, you want to be able to translate between any two languages.

Existing artificial intelligence methods generally use two languages' data as training samples and labels, using seq2seq, which is a sequence-to-sequence model, to complete the corresponding translation. This effect is good, but it is powerless for translation in some specific occasions and scenarios.

Because these models can only perform black-box operations and are not explainable.

The method I plan to use is to collect all the language data for each language, whether it is audio, text, or even corresponding images.

Afterward, a core language knowledge model will be trained for each language. As for this model, it will be very complex, with hundreds of billions of model parameters and influencing factors, so it requires massive data for training.

Of course, the advantage of this method is that you can later restore it based on the algorithms and models I provide, Master.

This way, when you need technical authorization and source code explanation later, Master, you can explain it clearly.

Otherwise, I wouldn't adopt such an inferior algorithm, because I am already an artificial intelligence with wisdom and the ability to learn autonomously, not a broken machine without a brain that only trains purely."

Upon hearing this, Li Bufan felt that alpha's idea for solving the problem was very constructive.

This way, it will be very convenient to explain in the future, and others will not associate this with true artificial intelligence.

At the same time, Li Bufan also knew that because this method requires massive data for learning, bandwidth would seriously affect the task completion rate.

However, Li Bufan thought of a not-so-good solution: "alpha, I have a way to help you solve the bandwidth problem and give you unlimited bandwidth.

You can first assign the tasks of data collection, processing, and training. You can send avatars into Google's cluster servers and let them use the vast resources there for calculations. After obtaining the parameter results, they can be returned to your main body in an encrypted way, and then you can restore the model, which is to complete the task.

However, I require that when you do this, you do not let your avatars be discovered in the Google cluster. I wonder if this plan is feasible for you?"

Instantly, the quantum computer case began to hum. After about 5 seconds, alpha replied:

Thank you, Master. My wisdom has just been upgraded because the idea you proposed is very constructive and completely feasible.

It made me realize the shortcomings in my thinking and improve it, and now this way of thinking has been anchored."

Li Bufan was very satisfied with this. It was not in vain for him to work so hard; he was considered to be one step ahead of artificial intelligence in terms of intelligence.

"According to this method, how long will it take to complete the task?"

"If it is to avoid being discovered, within 12 hours, the less time it takes to complete the task, the greater the probability of being discovered.

According to probability and fuzzy calculation, the optimal solution is after 22 hours, the task can be completed, and the probability of being discovered will be less than one billionth."

Li Bufan felt very good when he heard this; the time could be greatly reduced.

So he ordered: "Since that's the case, let's set it for about 22 hours.

After you get the data and build the model in 22 hours, you can make the software according to my requirements.

Remember, my requirements are: First, it must be cross-platform, supporting the three major operating systems for PC (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux), and supporting mobile platforms (Android and iOS).

Second, the interface should be simple and generous, support voice operation, and can run in the background.

Third, it should support DIY settings. For example, some people want to translate some modules in Facebook while keeping the original text, some want to translate everything. In short, it should support customization. Customization can be set manually or by voice operation.

That's about it. You can start acting."

"Understood, Master!" After speaking, alpha's stereoscopic Holographic Projection ended, and the quantum computer case began to make noise, but fortunately, the sound was not loud and did not disturb the public too much, so there was no problem.

Li Bufan was very concerned about his two "artifacts" - artificial intelligence and the quantum computer.

Whether the task can be completed successfully depends on the actual running situation of the software made by artificial intelligence at this time tomorrow.
