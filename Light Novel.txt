The map is divided into six colors: white, green, orange, red, dark purple, and black.

They represent urban areas, F-grade beast zones, E-grade beast zones, D-grade beast zones, and C-grade beast zones, respectively.

The strength of the beasts corresponds to the realm of martial artists.

F-grade beasts, equivalent to the Body Tempering realm, are simply inexhaustible to kill.

E-grade beasts, equivalent to the Warrior realm, are also numerous.

Above them are D-grade beasts equivalent to Martial Master level, and C-grade beasts equivalent to Martial General level.

It is said that B-grade beasts have appeared in the Red Maple City stronghold before, almost destroying the entire stronghold base.

As for A-grade beasts, they have never appeared in the Red Maple City stronghold, and once such powerful beasts appear, it represents a disaster of city destruction and death!

Legend has it that there are S-grade beasts above A-grade, existences that are enough to destroy the world, but no one has ever seen them.

In addition, beasts generally operate within their corresponding level of area, but the possibility of high-level beasts entering low-level areas is not small.

Many people have died because they encountered high-level beasts in low-level areas.

On the map, the entire Red Maple City stronghold is marked as a white area.

Outside the city, a large circle surrounding the wall is green, which is further divided into various irregular areas.

These green areas are the relatively safe F-grade areas, and the Wind Wolf Zone is located within them.

"Found you!"

Su Lang narrowed his eyes, revealing a hint of killing intent.

"Pa!"

Suddenly, someone gently patted his shoulder.

"Who!?"

Su Lang frowned and turned around, his eyes staring at the person like knivesâ€”a middle-level Body Tempering realm man with a beard.

"Don't be agitated! Ah ha, my name is Tan Zicheng..."

Tan Zicheng smiled obsequiously, "I saw you studying the map, are you going hunting outside the city?"

"What's it to you?"

Su Lang asked indifferently.

"You really want to go hunting? It's not that I'm talking too much, but outside the city is not only dangerous, but also troublesome."

Tan Zicheng chuckled, "I specialize in being a guide, assistant, burden carrier, and errand runner for people, earning a living. Do you need me?"

"How much money?"

Su Lang glanced at Tan Zicheng and smiled noncommittally.

"Only 50 silver coins!"

Tan Zicheng immediately replied, "Except for combat, you don't have to worry about anything. If you need me to participate in combat, you have to add money."

"I just need a guide."

Su Lang nodded, "You come with me, we'll leave the city after eating."

Immediately, Su Lang walked towards a restaurant, and Tan Zicheng followed behind, nodding and bowing.

The restaurant's dishes are very rich, including dishes made from various beast meats, and even vegetables containing spiritual energy.

Su Lang ordered a large table, costing 10 silver coins.

"This is really too sumptuous!"

Tan Zicheng looked excited, "I have never eaten such a sumptuous meal, thank you so much."

"Eat."

Su Lang smiled faintly.

After a whirlwind meal, Su Lang and Tan Zicheng returned to the city gate hall.

A moment later, the two passed through a narrow passage to the outside of the wall.

"This is the world outside the city!"

What appeared before Su Lang was an endless stretch of hills, and the place where the sky and earth met was a gloomy and terrifying primeval forest!

Further away were vaguely visible giant peaks piercing the clouds, standing tall and majestic like giants.
