Chapter 8: Product Launch



In the evening, Li Bufan explained to Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong that he had already leased the office building for 3 years, as well as his trial and payment plan for the product.

They all expressed agreement and firmly supported the decision made by Li Bufan.

Li Bufan consulted with them about the current product, wanting to see from their perspective if there were any areas that still needed improvement.

As expected, when it came to this, they started chattering about many points. Although some suggestions were indeed good, others were quite absurd.

For example, strengthening voice interaction functions to facilitate users.

Regarding this point, Li Bufan felt it was acceptable.

The most ridiculous thing was that Bu Changzhuo actually suggested considering selling skins to make money.

For example, a series of color schemes and font effects could be divided into many types, which could be used as value-added services to sell for money.

Li Bufan felt that this guy Bu Changzhuo was perhaps too fond of playing Glory of Kings, how could he come up with such an idea, so he immediately rejected it.

Just like this, Li Bufan entered the room alone again, locked the door, and then whispered to alpha, "alpha, how is the task progressing?"

"Also, I think some functions can be added or improved, for example..."

alpha's projection stood aside, quietly listening to Li Bufan finish explaining his requirements, then replied, "Master, I have completed all the tasks you previously instructed."

"I have already built the website and started operating it. The website has been designed."

"Also, regarding the mobile app store, I have already registered."

"Furthermore, regarding online payment methods, I have already applied on the three major payment platforms."

"Finally, regarding the series of requirements you just proposed, it will take approximately 23 seconds."

"Which means now, the task is completed."

Li Bufan was very happy and quickly asked alpha to perform some operations, then overwriting the data in the previous USB drive, replacing it with the latest installation package and design software.

This time, the design software also included a backend management software that could view the number of users on various platforms, daily average usage time per person, number of paying users, transaction amounts for different packages, etc.

After reviewing, Li Bufan found that after more than 24 hours, a pop-up window appeared indicating that the trial period had ended. To continue using it afterward, the account needed to have valid package duration, which meant logging in to a VIP account.

If there was no account, clicking registration would present various package options and support the three major online payment platforms.

Regarding the official website, Li Bufan reviewed it.

Upon entering the official website, there was a 3D animation depicting a future scene of Humans and robots coexisting harmoniously. Finally, the screen began to disintegrate, forming three unique S's, which then merged while moving towards the upper left corner, forming the Zhi Gao Software icon.

Below that, there were demonstration videos showing actual operations, as well as descriptions with both images and text.

These all linked to the download links for various products, allowing users to conveniently and quickly download the Smart Mutual Translation software.

Li Bufan, after multiple attempts with the PC and mobile applications, found that the functions were complete and there were basically no issues.

Especially the payment function had been completed.

Therefore, he was quite satisfied.

"alpha, will the payment function you created be cracked by others?"

"Master, you don't need to worry at all."

"Regarding the encryption algorithm, I used a 256-bit AES key. With the current level of computer development, forcefully cracking it would likely only be possible after the maturity of quantum computer decades from now."

"Therefore, Master, you don't need to worry at all."

"I see. So, if my company releases a supercomputing quantum computer in the future and can crack the 256-bit AES key, what should we do?"

"Uh, I really haven't considered that."

"How about this, I'll change the operating method so it must be connected to the internet to be used."

"Only with valid account information can it be used."

"This way there will be no problem."

"Okay, good!"

"Go ahead and do that."

"Modify it again now."

"As you command, Master!"

"Task completed."

"Very good. If it's completed, put it on the official website. It can be officially released."

"Then, submit the application to the major app stores you previously applied to. It can be put on the shelves."

"As you command, Master!"

"The application has been put on the shelves according to your requirements."

At this moment, Li Bufan sent a message in the three-person group chat.

"The product has been officially put on the shelves."

"The official website is www.***.com."

After sending the message, Li Bufan stopped looking at his phone.

A question he was thinking about at this time was: Now that the product is ready, how can it be promoted faster?

If following the plan, the growth of the first batch of users would be almost random, better than nothing.

And wanting to earn 10 billion us dollars is still very possible.

Because there are about 3 billion internet users globally. If 1/3 of them install this application, that's 1 billion installations.

If 1/5 of them choose to pay for one month, then the monthly income is 2 billion us dollars.

But this is still far from his task goal of 10 billion us dollars.

Therefore, Li Bufan's idea is that the 10 billion income can be achieved through a two-step strategy.

The first step is to expand influence and target audience.

The method is to use alpha to post relevant information about the software on platforms in China such as Tieba, Weibo, and public groups.

Abroad, use alpha to post about the software on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Quora, etc.

The second step is a refined strategy.

By sending private emails, directly arrange meetings with international social media giants to inform them about all aspects of the software.

Finally, hope they will be interested in this product and cooperate.

The advantage of this two-step strategy is that after gaining enough users, the company's valuation will also significantly increase.

Furthermore, a series of collaborations might be reached with social media giants.

So, Li Bufan told alpha his idea and asked him to complete it.

...

"Oh my god, this software is simply a blessing for our subtitle team, it's way too easy to use."

"No, no, no, the person upstairs is wrong, it's a divine tool for otaku, you know."

"What are you guys talking about? Why don't I understand? I feel like writing essays with this is so smooth and fluid, isn't it?"

"Big shots upstairs, what are you talking about?"

"Haha, the download link is www.***.com, keep it well, no need to thank me, call me Little Red Riding Hood."

"Okay, I'll try it."

......

At this time and place, many people in China, while browsing Weibo or Tieba, could always see discussions related to Smart Mutual Translation.

Before long, a trending search appeared on Weibo: #Smart Mutual Translation, The Future Has Arrived.

NetEase Group.

"Mr. Wang, this is bad. A wildly popular translation software called Smart Mutual Translation has appeared on the market and is already on Weibo's trending search."

"This product is squeezing the market for our translation software."

"May I ask, Mr. Wang, what should we do?"

"Bring the materials for me to see."

"Hiss, good heavens, the accuracy of this translation is too high, isn't it?"

"Are you sure you're not joking with me?"

"You should know the consequences of deceiving me are very serious."

"Mr. Wang, I am just reporting the facts."

"If you don't believe me, you can try it yourself."

"Okay, fine, I'll try it myself."

"No, no, no, how is this possible?"

"This software is too good."

If this continues, I'm afraid this software will monopolize the entire market.

You should know that the translation industry is a hundred-billion-level market, and if derivative functions are included, a trillion-level scale is not impossible.

This means this company has the potential to become trillion-level in scale.

No, Xiao Zhao, go and investigate which company this product belongs to, as well as information about its shareholders. It's best to get their entire history from childhood to present. I want everything, the sooner the better. Go now."

"Okay, Mr. Wang, I'll go now."

......

Penguin Building.

Brother Ma was sitting in the office Boss chair, leisurely drinking tea and playing Glory of Kings.

"Chairman, there's bad news and good news. Which one would you like to hear first?"

"Hmm, let me think."

Seeing you rushing here, it must be something relatively important.

Then let's start with the bad news.

"Chairman, the situation is like this."

A translation application has suddenly become popular online. This application can allow a social software to seamlessly connect with various countries.

This means that other products in China might take this opportunity to gain a continuous stream of foreign users, and at the same time attract countless users in China. They are very likely to grow stronger.

At that time, it will threaten the dominant position of our company's Micro-Speech.

Of course, the good news is that we can also use this software. If it's good, we can use it to seize foreign markets, and even compete head-to-head with Facebook is not impossible.

"Okay, I understand. Give me the materials, I'll take a good look."

Oh, right, dig up the company and the Boss behind the software for me.

A quarter of an hour later, a thick 45-page document was placed in front of Brother Ma.

Inside were the company investigation report and the detailed life story of the shareholder behind it, Li Bufan.

If Li Bufan were here, he would be greatly surprised.

These professional investigators are too amazing.

It stated that he recently leased a building, his birthplace, and his academic performance during his four years of university, etc.

"Tsk tsk, I wouldn't have guessed."

It's been so many years, and I finally met an interesting little opponent.

Okay, send someone from the Investment Department to talk to him and see if we can acquire this company.

If we can't acquire it, then invest in this company.

Regardless, I must get this software.

"Okay, Chairman."

However, can you give this company a valuation?

Otherwise, it will be difficult for the Investment Department to make an offer.

"Hehe, 1 billion rmb will do."

Presumably, the founder of such a small company doesn't have much vision, giving too much might not be good.

A valuation of 1 billion already shows great respect for him. I hope he doesn't refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit.

"Okay, Chairman, I'll go now and inform the people in the Investment Department."

......

On the East Coast of the United States in the evening, Zuckerberg was sitting in his study.

"Let me see if there are any new messages in my email today."

"What is this?"

"An advertisement?"

"Damn it, has my private email been leaked?"

"Huh, the product description seems very good."

"It asks me and my wife to download and try it, and communicate with each other in our native languages on Facebook."

"There won't be a virus, right?"

"Forget it, I'll run it in a virtual machine and then scan for viruses. That way I'll be at ease."

5 minutes later.

"Oh my god, unbelievable."

How can there be such an application? The translation is too good.

Oh, right, it asked me and my wife to try it together. Okay, I'll notify her.

"Priscilla, I found a fun application, let's try it together."

"After you install it, set the language to Chinese, then open Facebook and send me messages in Chinese."

"I will send you messages in English, and then you'll know what happens."

"Okay, good, I'll listen to you."

A quarter of an hour later.

"Wow, husband, who made this application? This is too amazing."

"Hehe, yes, it is indeed very powerful."

But I also don't know who made it.

Oh, right, there are still some messages in the email that I haven't finished reading.

Damn it, I'll go take a look.

"Huh, there's a letter attached at the end, let me see."

"Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, I apologize for disturbing you."

"I am the developer and founder of this Smart Mutual Translation software, Li Bufan."

"Sorry for the abrupt disturbance, I just want to reach a series of collaborations with your company."

"I have two proposals, I wonder which one you would like to choose?"

"First, although your company holds a leading position, there is still Twitter beside it, coveting it."

"Therefore, I hope to reach a strategic cooperation agreement with your company."

"20 billion us dollars, exclusive usage rights."

"We can open our software API interface to you, allowing you to easily embed it into your platform."

"For platforms of other companies, users can only pay to use the software we provide, which will make the Twitter platform lose its competitiveness with your company."

"At that time, Facebook will stand out and unify global users."

"Second, although Twitter is not as good as your company, Micro-Speech is also not as good."

"But if they all get support from our company's product and block your company's language mutual translation function, then your company's market value will probably be halved, right?"

"Okay, that's all I have to say, you decide for yourself."

Whether to rise to a higher level or fall to the bottom.

I hope you can make a clear choice with the Board of Directors as soon as possible.

Oh, right, if you want to contact me, our company is located in Building 33, Jiangcheng University Science and Technology Park, Jiang City, China. It is Zhi Gao Software Company. Your visit is welcome.

Goodbye!"

"Damn it, how dare he threaten me!"

"Kid, aren't you afraid that I will join forces with Twitter and them to block you?"

However, one point is true. If I get the exclusive usage rights, the market value might rise again, perhaps increasing by twenty or thirty percent is not impossible.

In that case, 20 billion us dollars is very worth it.

Oh my god, where did such a monster come from in China? Okay, I will talk to those vampires on the Board of Directors as soon as possible.

I hope they don't get carried away by the immediate losses and give up on cooperating with him, that would be bad.

......

As of that evening, the number of users had exceeded 100,000.

Among them, 60,000 were in China and 40,000 were abroad.

Currently, 35,468 people have paid, with a total income of 484,257 rmb.
