  <p>Crush everything!</p>
  <p>Destroy everything!</p>

  <p>Shadow quietly floated in the air, seemingly enjoying the feeling of people struggling to survive.</p>

  <p>The more the natives of the planet struggled, the happier he was.</p>

  <p>It was as if he could enjoy a delicious meal from this negative emotion.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">“However, this planet is a little strange. Why doesn’t it have a planet’s will?” Ying muttered.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">“Counterattack!”</p>

  <p>Ji Ruyue struggled to get rid of the powerful pressure on her body and swung her sword at the dark fog tribe that was crazily surging toward her!</p>

  <p>Under her call, everyone rose to resist.</p>

  <p class="highlight">Even if they had to die, they had to fight and Fall!</p>

  <p>Lin Xuan took a deep breath and used a face-to-face flame blast to kill the level 9 dark fog parasite in front of him.</p>
