Chapter 27 Aurora Special Effects Conference



On this day, Li Bufan arrived at the company as usual.

According to the previous plan, today's morning would be the press conference.

At that time, the company's new product would be introduced and subsequently announced to the public.

Simultaneously, the CEO of Huanyu Film and Television would also attend the ceremony.

Unlike the first hastily held press conference, this one was much more solemn and formal.

The media and Reporters invited to attend would receive red interview invitations.

Nearly two hundred media outlets or Reporters were present.

And those distinguished guests and friends would receive golden invitations symbolizing their status.

There were over a hundred guests present, including the Technical Director of Industrial Light & Magic, the Special Effects Supervisor of Alibaba Pictures, the Vice President of Warner Bros., the CEO of Disney Pictures, and representatives from various special effects studios both in China and abroad.

Fortunately, the fourth-floor hall of the company was cleared in advance, and the desks, chairs, and other office equipment inside were replaced with tiered high-end seating, neatly arranged.

The press conference was scheduled to start at 10 o'clock today, and it was now 8:30 AM, with guests and media already seated.

......

At exactly 10 o'clock, the press conference officially began.

Bu Changzhuo, dressed in a suit, walked towards the front stage with steady steps.

He looked at everyone present, nodded in greeting to the guests in the front row, then picked up the microphone and began his speech.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I am Bu Changzhuo, the CEO of Zhi Gao Software. It is a pleasure to be here, representing our company, to release this groundbreaking product."

"But first, I want to thank the media who have come and the guest friends present for your support."

"I hope that at this press conference, you will find your trip worthwhile and gain a lot."

"Alright, now, I will begin to introduce our company's second product, which is the special effects production software that you are already aware of."

"That's right, it is this. We call it Aurora Special Effects, just like the magical aurora in nature, seemingly real and illusory, like a dream paradise, making people immersed in it."

"Let's first talk about its basic parameters. This software is 1376MB in size and has functions covering almost all top-tier special effects production software on the market, as well as some unique functions."

"We made a bold innovation; we tried to integrate Artificial Intelligence technology with Aurora Special Effects."

"We are happy to say that we succeeded."

"Yes, Aurora Special Effects has a spirit or an Assistant, we call it Aurora."

"In terms of special effects processing, it can be said to have reached the level of a top engineer, and it has an advantage that Human cannot achieve - super high efficiency."

"Next, please watch a video demonstrating the use of the Aurora Assistant to complete a segment of special effects production. Perhaps this will subvert your perception and tradition of special effects production."

"Alright, without further ado, the video begins."

In the video, a special effects engineer received a request that was almost unbelievable.

According to the requirements report, he needed to create a hilly terrain covering one hundred square kilometers.

The similarity between these terrains could not exceed one-thousandth, meaning he needed to almost manually adjust a super large area of one hundred square kilometers.

Furthermore, the special effect to be completed in the requirements was to simulate a scene of a battle between two armies, each with a million soldiers, in this hilly terrain.

Among these armies, different facial features needed to be distinguishable.

And the weapons would also be varied and strange, and the art of war in the battle would also be diverse.

Such a complex special effects scene left this special effects engineer speechless and on the verge of collapse.

However, at this moment, he accidentally saw Aurora Special Effects, this brand new special effects software.

So, he clicked the link and started downloading.

After the download was complete, he encountered a problem that a novice would inevitably face: he didn't know how to use it.

Fortunately, he accidentally awakened the Assistant that was always on standby - Aurora.

Thus, through the Aurora Assistant, he quickly learned how to use this software.

However, for that overly demanding requirements report, he was still at a loss.

But, just as he was disheartened, he saw the cute appearance of the Aurora spirit, seemingly waiting for the Master's command.

He then decided to try anything and commanded the Aurora spirit to help him create a hilly terrain of one hundred square kilometers.

The Aurora spirit would communicate with him to further understand the details and characteristics of the terrain, thereby obtaining more detailed parameter characteristics, and at the same time obtaining real hilly terrain maps from the internet.

Finally, the spirit would integrate the two characteristics, thus creating the required hilly terrain piece by piece in the software window.

Ultimately, with the help of the spirit's magic and power, he successfully completed this incredibly difficult task and received a reward from the company, obtaining a substantial bonus, and from then on, he reached the peak of his life.

The video ended.

"Clap clap clap...."

A round of applause came from the audience, which lasted for over a minute.

"Thank you for your applause... I believe you have already seen the power of this special effects production software with an Artificial Intelligence Assistant in the video."

"Here, I solemnly promise that the performance of the spirit in the video above was not manually controlled but was filmed entirely based on real operating conditions."

"Therefore, please unleash your imagination and creativity and create the world of your dreams on the Aurora software!"

"With that, we have finished introducing the basic parameters of our Aurora Special Effects."

"However, this is not the end."

"Because we have added two platforms to Aurora Special Effects, two platforms that are both important and easy to use for everyone."

"First, let's talk about the first platform integrated into Aurora Special Effects."

"This is a resource trading platform."

"Here, you can find a large number of free or paid models and special effects animations provided by the official, and you can also publish your own works."

"When publishing, you can choose to make it free and share your results with others."

"You can also choose to charge a fee, allowing others to download your work after payment."

"Of course, for paid products, our platform will deduct 30% as a handling fee."

"We hope everyone can understand and accommodate this point."

"Finally, let's talk about the second platform of Aurora Special Effects."

"This platform has a very high threshold, especially for buyers."

"This is a special effects outsourcing platform."

"Here, you can post special effects tasks that cannot be completed due to insufficient time or technical skills on the platform and hand them over to other experienced and available studios for processing."

"You can also hand over all the post-production of your film to some well-known studios or to the platform, allowing the platform to complete it."

"For receiving and publishing tasks, we have set up a form similar to bidding."

"For the two parties signing the agreement, our platform will automatically draft a contract."

"After both parties officially sign the electronic signature on the contract, it will become effective."

"For some simple special effects tasks, we will allow ordinary individuals to accept them."

"For some more complex special effects tasks, only qualified studios or companies can accept them."

"And for some particularly complex special effects, if no company accepts the task, your time will not be wasted on the platform."

"We solemnly promise here that for any special effects task published on the platform, as long as the price is appropriate, if your task is not taken by other companies, our official team will also take on your task and provide the optimal special effects results."

"At the same time, our company also welcomes cooperation with major film producers, and we welcome everyone to cooperate and achieve win-win results."

"Because everything on this platform is charged."

"We also set up a 30-70 split as with the former, and we hope everyone can understand and respect us."

"Alright, the functions of the Aurora software have been introduced."

"As for the product, it will be available after the press conference ends. At that time, the official website will announce the download link and the product price list."

"Clap clap clap..."

Everyone thought the press conference was over and they could officially ask questions.

"Hello, I am a Reporter from Suzaku Media. I would like to ask, this software..."

"Excuse me, Madam Reporter. The press conference is not over yet."

"There is still an important announcement to be made."

"The Q&A session will be held after this, please wait a moment, fellow Reporters, thank you!"

At this moment, a young and beautiful lady slowly walked onto the stage.

That's right, she was Li Bufan's girlfriend, Madam Liu Yuting, the CEO of Huanyu Film and Television.

Liu Yuting took the microphone from Bu Changzhuo, looked at the audience, especially at Li Bufan sitting in the first row.

And Li Bufan saw Liu Yuting's seemingly pleading gaze, smiled, nodded at her, then brought his right hand's four fingers together and gave a thumbs up forward, indicating to her that she could do it.

Perhaps seeing Li Bufan's loving gaze and encouragement towards her, she mustered her courage and slowly began to speak.

"Good morning, everyone. I am Liu Yuting, the CEO and Chairman of Huanyu Film and Television."

"First of all, I would like to thank Zhi Gao Software for holding this press conference and allowing our Huanyu Film and Television to speak on stage."

"Perhaps you are not very clear about Huanyu Film and Television, but you must be very familiar with Tian Tian Reading."

"That's right, the one-yuan acquisition case before was our company."

"Our company has officially acquired Tian Tian Reading, and it is now a subsidiary of ours."

"And what does Huanyu Film and Television do?"

"To put it simply, it is very similar to major film companies; it makes movies and TV series."

"That's right, that's how it is. In the early stage, we will focus on film development."

"And we have already reached a strategic cooperation with Zhi Gao Software on the special effects production of films."

"In the future, any film produced by our company will undoubtedly use the technical support of Zhi Gao Software."

"And our Huanyu Film and Television currently has plans to shoot four films."

"Two of them will start shooting in the second half of this year, and the other two we will hand over to Zhi Gao Software to attempt an unprecedented unmanned virtual film."

"These four films are Blue Star Defense War, The Origin of the Hell Civilization. I, Mercury Exploration, and tales of the starry sky."

"That's right, the copyrights for these four films are all provided by the authors of Tian Tian Reading, and they will also enjoy one percent of the box office revenue."

"Among them, one film will be made as a sequel, and the other three films will be independent and complete."

"Huanyu Film and Television will kick off the casting auditions in early July."

"At that time, we welcome all well-known crew members to join our production process, and we also welcome all big-name stars to join our film casting. We will provide generous remuneration."

"Currently, our company still has over 4 billion in cash on hand."

"I think this is completely sufficient to pay your salaries and remuneration."

"Alright, action speaks louder than words."

"We welcome all people of insight to join Huanyu Film and Television and participate in the creation of films."

"Thank you all!"

After Liu Yuting finished speaking, she bowed to the audience, then returned the microphone to Bu Changzhuo, and walked off the stage.

Bu Changzhuo took the microphone and then slowly spoke to the audience.

"Fellow Reporters, it is now time for the Q&A session."

"Reporters with questions can raise your hands so I can see you."

"Each Reporter can only ask one question."

Hearing this, the Reporters in the audience rushed forward, raising their hands one after another, and some even raised both hands.

"Okay, this female Reporter in the blue top, you can ask the first question."

"Thank you for giving me the first question. I am Fan Zhibing, a Reporter from Jiangcheng Daily."

"I would like to ask your company, what is the level of your Artificial Intelligence?"

"Has it reached the level where it can pass the Turing Test as rumored?"

Bu Changzhuo shook his head and looked at the Reporter in the audience.

"Madam Fan, you think too highly of our company."

"Although our company's Aurora Assistant is very intelligent and can be called a master in special effects processing."

"However, in other aspects, it may not even be as good as a seven-year-old child."

"As for reaching the level of completely passing the Turing Test, I don't think any company can achieve that at present."

"After all, such a great honor would not be hidden by any company."

"And our Artificial Intelligence level can be said to be globally leading."

"From the previous Smart Mutual Translation, everyone can see that the translation field has reached the top, and now in special effects production, we have once again reached the peak."

"I think we will challenge more and more industries in the future, gradually developing Artificial Intelligence technology and using this technology to benefit Human."

"Okay, the Reporter in the black top in the front, you ask the second question."

"I am a Reporter from Yule Media, and I would like to ask Madam Liu Yuting."

"I would like to know what requirements your Huanyu Film and Television has for the actors you will be recruiting?"

"What kind of roles are waiting to be cast?"

Liu Yuting didn't expect someone to ask her, but she still walked onto the stage, picked up the microphone, pondered for a moment, and then spoke.

"Hello, fellow Reporter."

"Regarding this question, I can give a very clear answer."

"First of all, all roles in these two films, including the protagonists, important supporting roles, and some extras, will be openly and transparently recruited by our company. The capable will get the position."

"As for the requirements for actors, they are actually very simple."

"First, they must have good character and be kind people. I think most stars meet this point."

"Secondly, it is ability, not the specific skills a person possesses, but it is distinguished by the degree of fit with the role played and how well the role is played."

"Finally, we want to promote ourselves. The Bole is already here, fellow Qianlima, what are you waiting for?"

Just like that, about seven or eight Reporters asked questions. Some questions were quite challenging, while others were relatively easy to answer. Fortunately, everything went smoothly in the end.

The press conference was a complete success.

After it ended, Li Bufan walked up to Liu Yuting, pulled her into his arms, and stroked her hair.

"You performed very well on stage, you worked hard."

Liu Yuting smiled, finding Li Bufan's praise very pleasing.

"It's okay, I'm very happy too."

"Okay, let's go. I'll hold a celebration banquet for you at noon. Let's enjoy some delicious food."

"Okay, that sounds good. Thank you, Li Bufan."

......

Meanwhile, the download link for the Aurora Special Effects Software was released on the official website of Zhi Gao Software, and countless traffic poured in instantly.

Some were there to download, and some were hackers trying to disrupt and steal server files.

However, Zhi Gao Software was as solid as a rock and unbreakable, and those hackers had no choice but to give up on their attack plan.

And companies that downloaded the software were immediately amazed after trying Aurora Special Effects. It was exactly the same as the video played at the press conference; it was truly incredible.

Some small studios were very foresighted and saw the business opportunities within. They began to abandon their previous special effects software and recruit staff, all adopting Aurora Special Effects for production.

It was clearly visible on the stock market that the stocks of the companies behind those special effects production software plummeted again, with many market values nearly halved.

However, after some special effects companies officially announced that they would start using Aurora software, the stock market values of these companies began to rise slightly.

......

The aftereffects of this press conference were not limited to this. Far away in the United States, a series of high-tech companies such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft were holding a meeting that would affect the future.
