Chapter 1:6: Think about life and go home often



Today was the company's dividend day. After paying personal income tax, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong each had tens of millions left. As for Li Bufan, he had billions.

Li Bufan saw them staring at the balance on his bank card and chuckled foolishly, feeling very happy himself.

After all, his good brothers were working with him and moving towards prosperity together. Just thinking about it made him excited.

Li Bufan looked at them.

"Second Brother, Third Brother. What do you plan to do with this money?"

You know, we no longer have to worry about food or clothing now.

If we need anything, we can completely use the company's public funds for consumption."

"I plan to buy a villa and a sports car, and then there won't be much money left.

After that, the remaining money will all go to my parents."

"I plan to donate a bright asphalt road to my hometown village.

Then I'll tear down the house in my hometown and rebuild it beautifully, and after that, I'll contract a fish pond to raise fish.

The main reason is that my parents told me a long time ago that they wanted to return to the countryside to retire when they got old.

They could occasionally fish, raise cats and dogs, grow vegetables, and play mahjong and cards with some neighbors."

Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong spoke one after another, talking about how they would use the money.

Li Bufan nodded upon hearing this, thinking, 'That's all good, very filial.'

At this moment, Bu Changzhuo looked at Li Bufan and asked curiously.

"What about you, Brother? You have billions, what do you plan to do?"

Li Bufan thought for a moment and then replied to Bu Changzhuo.

"As for me, I will buy two large villas, one for my parents and the other for myself.

Then I will buy three sports cars, a Lamborghini worth around 20 million for myself, and a sports car worth around 10 million for each of my parents.

Then, I will buy another plane. It seems the Gulfstream from the United States is very good, and it seems to cost several hundred million.

A plane is mainly for convenience when traveling long distances in the future.

Then I'll give my parents 100 million each for pocket money.

The remaining money, I will deposit in the bank as personal funds.

This money, perhaps, will be the capital for my comeback in the future."

"Comeback? What do you mean by that?"

Bu Changzhuo looked at Li Bufan, puzzled.

Li Bufan smiled and said.

"This is being prepared for the unexpected.

You don't really think this company can last, do you?

I have a feeling, and it's getting stronger recently.

I feel like we may have accidentally angered many people and broken many people's rice bowls.

Think about it, our Smart Mutual Translation first disrupted the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of language translators.

They usually relied on helping some cross-border companies write copy and do translation work. This was just to make a living, but now it has been disrupted by us.

Think about it, if one day our product affects the employment of tens of millions of people, what will we face?"

Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong thought for a moment, but still shook their heads, not knowing if they didn't dare to say or if they really didn't know.

Li Bufan continued to add.

"For a beggar who hasn't eaten for days, food is the most important thing.

For a traveler who has been running in the desert for a long time, water is the most important thing.

For a rich young master with abundant material wealth and a net worth of tens of billions, spiritual enjoyment is the most important thing.

But, what if they respectively lost food, water, and spiritual enjoyment?

First, the rich young master can only live an ordinary life, and life loses its fun for him.

Secondly, for the beggar and the traveler, losing food and water means their lives are coming to an end.

At this time, they will burst out with two hundred percent of their strength, breaking all social shackles and constraints, and will not care about the life and death of others or normal laws.

They will fight desperately for survival. You should have all heard of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

At the bottom of the pyramid, and also the most important and basic need, is the need for survival.

Think about it, if we break the rice bowls of tens of millions of people, those people might tolerate it for a while.

But because they have no salary and cannot get paid, if society does not extend a helping hand, their assets will be depleted.

At this time, they will have no more scruples.

Think about it, if they collectively smash and loot our industries, and surround and intercept our company personnel, our assets will instantly be zeroed out."

"Brother, are you thinking too far ahead? What you're saying shouldn't be possible, right?"

"That's right, it won't happen. But only because the danger will be nipped in the bud.

That is to say, our company may be forced by relevant departments to stop providing relevant services or products to certain industries, for example, stopping providing translation services to some companies or individuals, so as to solve the employment problems of unemployed people in society.

Because the state cannot watch tens of millions of people doing nothing and being unemployed. This will seriously affect social stability and citizens' happiness, and will also lower people's living standards.

So, sometimes we haven't done anything wrong, and technology is neither good nor bad, but our company can only be the scapegoat.

Maybe by then, the company will no longer be controlled by us, do you understand?"

Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong were stunned, not expecting that such a possibility existed.

"Brother, aren't you thinking too far ahead? How could we possibly affect so many people? After all, that's tens of millions of people!"

Li Bufan sneered.

"Hehe, what if I said that my company has developed artificial intelligence?

Or what if our company develops robots?

This will cause massive unemployment of hundreds of millions of people.

By then, do you think everyone will praise our company or belittle our company?

By then, our production lines will be smashed, our products will be destroyed, our buildings will be burned down, and our employees will be like rats running across the street, everyone shouting to beat them."

At this time, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong's faces were ugly.

"Brother, then what do you say we should do in the future? Should we not launch good products from now on?"

Li Bufan shook his head.

"No, on the contrary. We not only need to launch high-tech products, but also promote them vigorously."

Bu Changzhuo was very confused, looking at Li Bufan with a look full of doubt.

"Why is that? Since you know doing this will cause a large number of people to lose their jobs, why do you still want to promote it?"

Li Bufan smiled, the corners of his mouth slightly raised.

"I am conducting an experiment, an experiment that concerns our future whereabouts.

Specifically, it is not convenient for us to say clearly.

You just need to know that if our company really encounters the situation I guessed before, then we will give up the company, go far away, and start our own business.

If, on the contrary, people always welcome and accept it, and our company operates smoothly, then we just need to work hard, follow the rules, and promote technological progress."

At this time, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong nodded, expressing their agreement.

Although they did not understand the reason why Li Bufan said this, they knew that as long as they followed Li Bufan, they would have a good life.

In fact, Li Bufan told them all this today mainly because he often felt someone following him on the road recently, feeling uneasy all day and unable to sleep soundly at night.

These days, although the company's official website is attacked by hackers every day, the enemy seems to have no other extra actions, which is a bit abnormal.

Furthermore, the relevant departments have not established a friendly communication channel with the company, which makes Li Bufan feel like he has a thorn in his back.

It felt like a storm was brewing, as if something big was about to happen.

Therefore, Li Bufan told them these heartfelt words.

Li Bufan cast aside the distracting thoughts in his mind and stopped thinking about unhappy things.

He looked at Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong, and asked with a smile.

"Second Brother, Third Brother. Today is the company's dividend day, which is a day worth celebrating.

I'll treat everyone to a seafood buffet at a five-star hotel."

"Haha, yes, the last time I went to a five-star hotel was when a relative treated me. I remember there were thousands of dishes, and every one of them was delicious."

"Wow, I've never been to a five-star hotel. I wonder how the buffet there is. Let's go and try it."

After everyone had eaten and drunk their fill, they walked on the street. Li Bufan saw men and women walking together and had an indescribable feeling.

It seemed to be envy, it seemed to be jealousy, and there were also memories and longing.

Li Bufan couldn't help but think of his ex, and the little things they did together.

Then he shook his head, let the past be the past, and look forward.

Everyone returned to the rented house. It was not big, but it was very warm, and it felt like they were back in the university dormitory.

At this time, Bu Changzhuo found Li Bufan, a little shy and embarrassed.

"Second Brother, what's wrong with you? Why are you acting like a girl? If you have something to say, say it quickly; if you have a fart, let it go quickly. Don't dawdle."

"Haha, my parents just called. They asked me why I haven't come home since graduating."

I told them that I started a business with you brothers and that I'm already quite rich now.

They were worried I was being tricked and said they wanted me to come home so they could properly confirm it."

"Oh, I thought it was something important. Thinking about it, that actually makes some sense."

It's been a while since we graduated, but none of us have gone home.

The last time we went home was during the New Year, right? It really is time to go back.

How about this: the three of us will arrange the company's tasks for the next few days, find some subordinates, and temporarily hand over the work.

Then, the three of us will take a few days off, and everyone can go back and spend time with their parents.

It would be best to have our parents quit their jobs and bring them to Jiang City to enjoy life. That way, it will be very convenient to visit them in the future.

What do you guys think?"

Hearing this, everyone nodded in agreement.

Just like that, the next day, everyone briefly handed over some arrangements and work to the company's senior management.

Then, each of them bought a sports car and prepared to drive home.

"Knock, knock, knock...."

Li Bufan didn't inform his parents in advance as usual, but instead went directly to the door of his home and knocked.

"Who is it?"

"Mom, it's me, Li Bufan."

With a "bang", the door opened.

"Son, why have you only just come back? Didn't your school graduate half a month ago?

Also, where is your luggage? Did you mail it all?

But that's not right either, why didn't you even bring a change of clothes?"

Li Bufan put on his slippers, neatly stacked his shoes, placed them on the shoe cabinet, and then gently closed the security door.

"Mom, I specifically drove home today to see you guys.

I'll only stay at home for two or three days at most before I have to leave."

"What's going on? Tell Mom clearly. What exactly is the situation?"

"Mom, a lot has happened since graduation.

Is Dad home? Call him over, and I'll tell both of you together. Otherwise, I'll have to say the same thing again later."

"Okay, okay. Your Dad went downstairs to play cards. I'll call him home."

Five minutes later.

"What's wrong? I was just winning big, I won over 200 yuan! You interrupting me like this, I don't know when I'll be this lucky again.

Also, I just came in from outside the complex, and I actually saw a Lamborghini parked downstairs.

I don't know which family's luxury car it is, it looks like it costs over 20 million yuan.

Someone who can afford such an expensive car, I don't know why they would live in a house that costs around two million."

"Child's Dad, I called you home because our son is back.

I saw he didn't bring any luggage and said he had something important to tell us."

The three of them sat around the coffee table in the living room, with a plate of peeled fruit and a plate of melon seeds and snacks in front of each person.

"Dad, the sports car you saw downstairs just now... well, actually, I bought it."

"You extravagant, father-cheating brat! Tell me, did you borrow money through online loans? No wonder you didn't even bring luggage!"

"Son, don't do anything foolish!"

"Uh, Mom and Dad, you've misunderstood."

Am I really that worthless in your eyes?"

Then, as expected, his parents nodded, which made Li Bufan's mouth twitch. This insult was too great, wasn't it?

"Mom and Dad, you've misunderstood. This is a car I bought after I started a company and made money.

Also, the money my company makes is tens of thousands of times more than this Lamborghini."

"How much is tens of thousands? Hundreds of billions?"

Son, where did you get so much money? Even robbing a bank wouldn't be as exaggerated as you, right?

Did you pry open the bank vault or something?"

"Mom and Dad, don't worry, this money came through legitimate means. I opened a company called Zhi Gao Software, specializing in software.

This company previously cooperated with Facebook abroad and received 20 billion US dollars.

This matter was a trending topic on Weibo, if you don't believe me, take a look."

Li Bufan opened his phone, showing the screen to his parents while operating it.

He opened Weibo, entered "Zhi Gao Software 20 billion" in the search bar, and searched.

Indeed, what came into view were news articles, pictures, and comments one after another.

Among them, there happened to be a photo capturing the scene of Li Bufan and Zuckerberg signing the contract on the same stage.

At this moment, Li Bufan's parents looked at Li Bufan in disbelief, examining him with the gaze one would use for a monster.

"Ahem... well, since you've seen the truth, you should believe it now, right?"

"Alright, son. As expected of our old Li family's seed, the ancestral genes are excellent, haha."

"Mom and Dad, I came today mainly to spend a couple of days with you and let you know I'm safe.

Then I think you can quit your jobs and enjoy your retirement properly. From now on, I will support our family.

I'm rich now, and I plan to buy you a villa to live in. Occasionally, I'll also come over to freeload meals and keep you company."

"Okay, good, child's Dad. Let's listen to our son and quit our jobs.

We've worked for most of our lives, it's time to enjoy ourselves properly.

To be honest, I've always envied people who live in villas. Now I didn't expect my son could help me fulfill this wish. It's really great."

"Okay, good, we'll listen to our son."

"Mom and Dad, give me your bank card numbers, and I'll give you some pocket money first.

If you don't have enough money in the future, just ask me."

"Ah, no need. Your Dad and I have worked for so long, we still have some savings.

It's enough for daily expenses."

"Mom, how much savings do you have?

I'm making a lot of money now. If I don't even give it to you, won't people talk behind my back?"

"Alright then, my bank card number is 73764646, and your Dad's bank card number is 27561346."

"Okay, done. The transfer is complete, take a look."

"Beep, your Gonghang bank card ending in 4646 received 100 million yuan at 14:26:38 on July 15th. The balance is 100,043,8676 yuan."

"Beep, your Jianhang bank card ending in 1346..."

At this moment, the SMS notification sounds on both of their phones rang out.

They picked up their phones to look, and while not looking was fine, looking gave them a fright.

It was actually 100 million yuan. To be honest, they had never seen so much money before.

"Son, isn't this a bit too much?"

"Mom, just don't think it's too little. Your son alone has donated over 60 billion yuan.

After all, money is just a string of numbers if you don't use it, it's completely useless.

So, Mom and Dad, in the future, please don't save money for me.

Buy yourselves a luxury car, and add more luxury goods, high-end clothes, and such.

Also, in the future, drive to large supermarkets when buying groceries, or have people deliver them. Don't go to the wet market to save a dime or two.

Since you have money, you should act like rich people.

Of course, I also don't want you to waste money, for example, on gambling.

Even if you gamble, you can only gamble small amounts, ten yuan or a hundred yuan per hand. After all, small gambling is for pleasure, big gambling harms the body. Even though my family has a large fortune, it can't withstand reckless spending.

Hmm, that's probably it."

"Okay, our son has grown up and is sensible. Alright, what our son said is right, we will listen to you from now on.

But according to what you mean, you don't plan to live with us in the future?"

"Yes, that's right. I might be busy with work very late in the future, my schedule is irregular, and who knows, maybe I'll find a girlfriend later, hehe.

But Mom and Dad, don't worry, I will visit you often when I have time in the future."

"Okay, fine. You're not young anymore, you can find a girlfriend and let us hold a grandchild sooner."

"Ahem... I'm still young, let's talk about that later."

"Okay, good. Son, you've finally come home. Come and try Mom's specialty dishes."

"Okay, alright. It's been a long time since I ate Mom's home-cooked meals."

And just like that, Li Bufan returned home.

Afterwards, he took his parents to Jiangcheng City to buy a villa, and accompanied them, letting them each buy a luxury car, and then they moved into a three-story villa.

Finally, after staying with his parents in the villa for one night, Li Bufan left them and returned to the company.
