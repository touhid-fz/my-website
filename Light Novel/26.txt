Chapter 26: Universal Pictures' Actions



After successfully acquiring Tian Tian Reading, Li Bufan intended to fulfill his promise to Liu Yuting, which was to merge Tian Tian Reading into Huanyu Film and Television.

However, for the acquisition, Huanyu Film and Television only had a meager 5 billion yuan in funds on its books.

Therefore, Li Bufan planned to package and sell Tian Tian Reading to Huanyu Film and Television at a friendly price of 1 yuan.

This process was equivalent to a transfer from the left hand to the right hand, the difference being that one was a wholly-owned company, while the other was a company in which he held half the shares.

Fortunately, the other half was held by Li Bufan's woman, so they could be considered a family.

Thus, Li Bufan did not hesitate and summoned Bu Changzhuo to explain the situation to him.

When Bu Changzhuo learned that Li Bufan wanted Tian Tian Reading to be merged into Huanyu Film and Television for 1 yuan, he was quite unwilling.

After all, no matter what, he was the one who completed this acquisition task.

Now, Li Bufan was half-giving it away to Liu Yuting, making Bu Changzhuo feel a bit sour and envious.

But he knew that Li Bufan had absolute disposal rights over the company, so even if he didn't want to agree, it would be impossible to change Li Bufan's mind.

Instead of having a conflict with Li Bufan over this, it was better to obediently follow Li Bufan's arrangements.

Just like that, after the news of Tian Tian Reading being transferred again spread, people were in a state of panic.

Many people had already resigned these past few days because they did not trust the new owner and believed it would not bring them a promising future.

Regarding this, Li Bufan's statement was that if they wanted to leave, they could, but if they wanted to come back, they shouldn't even think about it, and he would make them regret it later.

Finally, whether or not it was intentional by Bu Changzhuo, after the news of the 1 yuan acquisition of Tian Tian Reading was revealed, the internet exploded.

Many onlookers expressed that if it was so cheap, they could buy a dozen.

Then someone started searching for what kind of company Huanyu Film and Television, which acquired Tian Tian Reading for 1 yuan, was.

After checking, they found that the legal representative turned out to be a woman who had just graduated from university.

Then they found out that half of the shares were held by Li Bufan, who had full control of Zhi Gao Software.

Then another insider broke the news online, saying that she was a small employee in the operations department of Zhi Gao Software before, and overnight she counterattacked and became a wealthy and beautiful woman.

Thus, netizens began to speculate about what had happened.

Among them, the most widely accepted theory was that they must have an unspeakable relationship.

She had successfully risen to power by selling her looks.

Although what these netizens said was a little close to the truth, it sounded very uncomfortable to hear.

After Liu Yuting saw it, she contacted Li Bufan and asked him to explain.

Li Bufan thought for a moment and posted an update below his personal Weibo:

【Photo】 I heard you are all looking for her?

Okay, it seems I have to make it official.

She is my girlfriend, well, that's it.

Oh, by the way, our company's press conference will be held on the 5th floor of the Zhi Gao Software Building in three days.

At that time, she will appear and explain to everyone what Huanyu Film and Television is and what Huanyu Film and Television will do.

At that time, all entertainment companies, production companies, special effects companies, and cinema companies are welcome to attend the press conference.

Then he used the company's Weibo to repost his own Weibo, and added a comment: Congratulations to our handsome Chairman.

Media and film and television related companies that wish to attend the press conference can leave a comment below, and we will select and announce them before tomorrow.

Li Bufan took two screenshots, one of his own Weibo and one of the company's official Weibo, and forwarded them to Liu Yuting.

"Tingting, what do you think of this?"

"Mmm, Li Bufan, thank you."

"Haha, it's nothing, as long as you are happy.

Oh, by the way, has the merger of Tian Tian Reading into Huanyu Film and Television been completed?

When are you going to promote those people? I can help you vet them."

"Yes, it has been merged.

For those who remained and didn't leave, I promised them increased salaries and bonuses, so they were very willing to stay and serve the company.

Also, I plan to promote some people to departmental managers at Huanyu Film and Television today.

How about this, I'll send you the list of people I plan to promote, and you can help me review it."

"Mmm, no problem, just send it over.

I will reply as soon as possible."

After a while, a long list was sent to Li Bufan's Micro-Speech.

Li Bufan saved the image to his album and then began to contact alpha.

"alpha, are you there? Help me check the identities of these people, see if there are any suspicious personnel, and then check their character and their ability for the relevant positions, see if there are any adjustments needed."

"Master, I am here.

Yes, Master!"

"After verification, there are 2 individuals suspected of being spies lurking in Tian Tian Reading, hired by foreign forces.

There are 3 individuals with improper conduct.

There is 1 individual whose ability does not match the position."

"Mmm, alright, give me the evidence and send it all to Liu Yuting."

"Yes, Master!

Evidence compiled, sent to Liu Yuting's Micro-Speech messages."

"Let me see.

Mmm, very detailed, and also includes each person's experience and performance at work.

Mmm, very good."

"Thank you for the Master's praise, it is my honor to serve the Master.

May I ask if the Master has any other instructions?"

"Mmm, not for now."

"Okay, Master, I'm leaving.

Waiting for the Master's summons at any time."

Liu Yuting's Micro-Speech suddenly received many messages, and when she opened them, she was startled.

Because these messages were too detailed, it made her have a terrifying thought.

Did he also use this method to check my information, but in the end, there should have been no problem, so he let down his guard?

Mmm, it must be like this.

Fortunately, the person with this ability is my boyfriend.

Liu Yuting read through these materials one by one, silent, not expecting that even though she had worked so hard to select them, there were still problems.

So she thought of the almost omnipotent Li Bufan, and asked.

"Li Bufan, thank you for the information, it is very detailed and very useful.

But I'm really sorry, if it weren't for your investigation, perhaps our company would have suffered huge losses."

"Hehe, it's okay.

I'm also very happy to be able to help you, little fool."

"Hehe.

Li Bufan, you are the best to me!

Oh, by the way, regarding the missing positions, I want you to help me find someone suitable and send me their information, okay?"

"Mmm, okay, wait a moment."

Then, Li Bufan summoned alpha again.

"alpha, are you there? I need your help again.

Regarding the missing positions you checked before, see if there are any excellent ordinary employees who can replace them.

Then organize the information and send it to Liu Yuting."

"Master, I am here.

Yes, Master!

After searching, I found the most suitable candidates for these positions, they are xx...

The results have been sent to Liu Yuting's Micro-Speech messages.

May I ask, Master, if you have any other instructions?"

"Mmm, let me see, mmm, very detailed.

Wow, the people you selected are indeed excellent, it seems they were originally pearls covered in dust.

Okay, for now, there's nothing else."

"Okay, Master, I'll take my leave first, call me if you need anything."

In less than three minutes, Liu Yuting received another complete set of information, containing the most suitable candidates for these positions.

Liu Yuting was speechless at Li Bufan's efficiency, admiring him immensely.

Finally, she decided to use the people recommended by Li Bufan.

After Liu Yuting took over Tian Tian Reading, the first measure for platform rectification was implemented.

For authors with published works, a protocol window would pop up, stating:

Dear Author, Hello.

Tian Tian Reading would like to make a deal with you.

Are you willing to fully entrust all copyrights of your work xxx, including book publishing rights, merchandise rights, film and television adaptation rights, game adaptation rights, etc., to Tian Tian Reading?

Among them, for book publishing rights, you will receive normal market treatment, so you don't have to worry about your interests.

As for film and television rights, your work may appear on the screen, and you will have the honor of sharing one percent of the global box office revenue of the film and television drama adapted from your work.

Note, no matter what the box office is, even if it is 10 billion yuan, you can still get one percent.

As for merchandise and game rights, they will be handled in the same way as before, and we will ensure that your interests are not harmed.

You can choose to agree for some works and choose not to for others.

If you agree, your work will receive free exposure opportunities on the homepage recommendations.

Each work will have at least one opportunity.

Secondly, your work will have a higher probability of being valued by Huanyu Film and Television and adapted into a film or television drama.

Finally, whether you agree or not, your due rights will not be harmed.

As for new authors, at the beginning of publication, they can choose whether to agree to transfer various copyrights of the book.

As soon as the matter of transferring copyrights was revealed, ordinary authors were very excited.

This meant that their literary works could get higher exposure, and once adapted into a movie, they could also share in the box office revenue.

Is there anything better than this?

As for those great god authors, they usually enjoyed "privileges" that ordinary authors did not.

That is, when a new book is just published, it will be actively signed by the Editor-in-chief and given advertising space and homepage promotion.

And they were used to being high above, how could they bear to be treated the same as ordinary authors.

But there was no alternative, signing meant that their works were more likely to be adapted into movies than others.

Therefore, they still adhered to the "True Fragrance Law", and one by one, they rushed to sign the agreement with the platform.

The platform did a good job on this point, although the copyright was transferred, the previous cooperation would not be denied by Tian Tian Reading, and support would still be provided.

And those authors who did not have previous cooperation had to give up a part of their interests to Tian Tian Reading in order to get the opportunity for Tian Tian Reading to recommend the work to publishers and game distributors.

...

At this time, Li Bufan was in the company, gathering employees from the Software Development Department and the Aurora Special Effects Department to the conference room for a meeting.

After these few days of adjustment and familiarization, everyone was very familiar with the two software, Aurora Reversal and Aurora Special Effects.

Among them, Aurora Reversal is used to convert scripts into a series of materials such as models, scenes, and special effects in the Aurora Special Effects format.

It is convenient for subsequent modifications on this basis, greatly saving time, but this software is only for use within the company and is a classified product.

And no one has leaked any information about this heaven-defying product so far.

And Aurora Special Effects will be a product launched for sale on the market.

These days, everyone has also summarized some issues that can be improved in the software.

Li Bufan briefly looked at these issues, and they were indeed simple, but some functions were very practical.

Then he looked at the personnel in the Software Development Department.

"Wang Zixu, your Software Development Department should have received suggestions for improving Aurora Special Effects, right? How long do you estimate it will take to complete?"

"Chairman, I calculated it.

If we make it, it will take two weeks.

But we can completely release the current version first, and future updates can just be put on the official website.

In fact, our current version is already excellent enough."

"Mmm, okay, then let's do it that way, release the current version first.

As for the improvements, Wang Zixu, you still need to put more effort into it.

It's okay if it takes a little longer, you must ensure the quality, understand?"

"Mmm, rest assured, Chairman."

Next, Li Bufan told everyone about the two types of agreements reached with Huanyu Film and Television.

In fact, everyone was very clear that this Huanyu Film and Television was actually also Li Bufan's industry, but the other half of the shares were in the hands of the Chairman's girlfriend.

After hearing Li Bufan tell them about the agreements, they thought of the heaven-defying function of Aurora Reversal and the super-high efficiency of Aurora Special Effects production, and felt that this agreement was completely profitable.

Furthermore, Li Bufan finally stated that he would take out one-tenth of the company's project profits as dividends for everyone present, with everyone getting a share.

Immediately, everyone's enthusiasm was mobilized, and one by one, they expressed that they guaranteed to complete the task.

...

Meanwhile, in a building two blocks away, Liu Yuting was holding a mobilization meeting with her subordinates.

"Everyone, I don't care if you were from Tian Tian Reading before or were hired later.

Now, you need to know that you are working for Huanyu Film and Television.

Of course, Tian Tian Reading still belongs to Huanyu Film and Television.

Next, I will assign everyone's tasks.

First, find a few popular IPs on Tian Tian Reading and see if their authors are willing to sign a copyright transfer agreement with the company.

If they are willing, find a few novels among them that are more suitable for making science fiction and fantasy films.

In the early stage, we will use short stories, which on the one hand can increase everyone's experience, and on the other hand, the films produced can be tested on the market, which is convenient for the company to formulate corresponding plans in the future.

Oh, by the way, the situation I mentioned is the second type of cooperation reached with Zhi Gao Software, which is the way of shooting a small number of scenes and providing scripts."

"Next, find a few that are more suitable for the first type of cooperation, which is where we complete all the preliminary shooting work.

The post-production special effects processing will be handed over to Zhi Gao Software.

These works require more real scenes, which will greatly shorten the post-production special effects production time."

"We will proceed simultaneously with these two types of cooperation.

Finally, we will conduct an internal company evaluation, with the score determined by market box office and our company's revenue.

The type of cooperation with the highest revenue will become our mainstream in the future."

"That is to say, we will either mostly maintain the same shooting method as in the past, or mostly adopt the virtual film method to complete the cooperation with Zhi Gao Software."

"Alright, everyone go and get to work."

After the meeting ended, everyone began to work, some were searching for information, some were contacting the staff of Tian Tian Reading, and some were contacting artists under some well-known brokerage companies.

Just like that, Huanyu Film and Television officially began operations.

This film company, which would become the greatest in the future, quietly started operating and would reveal its claws to the world.

Let China style become people's first choice, let China culture sweep the world, let China people regain cultural confidence, and add a rich and colorful stroke to the great rejuvenation of the China nation.
