Chapter 25 Establishment of Universal Pictures



That afternoon, Li Bufan told everyone about the results of his secret meeting with Ma Dage in the morning.

Wang Huadong said he would cooperate with the relevant work.

Bu Changzhuo patted his chest and said, "Brother, regarding the offshore company, I have already found a suitable one."

That is a company registered in the Cayman Islands, named Brilliant Star, with a professional white glove team.

They have handled underground transactions for many organizations and enterprises, and their integrity is very high. They are very professional and will not even ask too much about the user's specific identity or leak user information.

I have already negotiated with them, and after the matter is completed, we will pay them about 16 million us dollars, which is equivalent to 100 million yuan.

And I have already assembled a professional acquisition team.

You don't know, those employees in the investment department have been clamoring for a long time, wanting to open up the market and find tasks.

This task made them very excited."

Li Bufan was very satisfied to see that Bu Changzhuo had made very proper arrangements.

"Not bad. Since that's the case, then you can go busy yourself. I require the acquisition to be completed within three days. It's not difficult, right?"

"Haha, don't worry, no problem."

...

That night, Li Bufan returned home, had a passionate time with Liu Yuting, and after a short rest, told Liu Yuting everything that had happened that day.

Liu Yuting, upon hearing that Li Bufan had met the internet mogul, Ma Dage, showed the reaction of an ordinary netizen meeting a celebrity. She was very excited, seemingly not yet accustomed to the change in her identity.

Li Bufan did not blame Liu Yuting, but just coughed a few times as a reminder.

This cough seemed to startle Liu Yuting, making her pause, then realize the difference in her current identity, and her pretty face flushed, feeling a bit embarrassed.

After learning that Li Bufan was going to acquire Ma Dage's largest online literature reading brand, Tian Tian Reading, she was even more excited.

Because she knew that once this highly active online literature platform was in her hands, the many popular IPs within it would instantly become hot super special effects blockbusters, reaping countless people's pockets and acquiring massive box office revenue.

Her face was flushed, and she looked at Li Bufan, feeling a little embarrassed.

Seeing Liu Yuting's shy and hesitant look, Li Bufan felt that she had something to say, so he spoke.

"Tingting, we are already an old couple, what can't you tell me?"

"Pfft. What old couple? Am I that old?"

"Uh, is it okay if I was wrong? Just say whatever you want to say."

"Mmm. Then this little woman will dare to ask for a gift."

Li Bufan was a little puzzled. He thought about it and confirmed that after they confirmed their relationship, he really hadn't given her any decent gifts.

So, he answered without hesitation.

"Say it, what gift is it?"

"You have to agree first before I can say it. If you don't agree, I won't say it."

Li Bufan was a little speechless, looking at her cute and shy appearance when she was acting spoiled, which was very endearing. Finally, he nodded and said.

"Except for the shares of Zhi Gao Software, anything else is fine. Tell me, what is the gift?"

"Hehe, hubby is so good.

I want Tian Tian Reading to be merged into Huanyu Film and Television. After all, they are both in the entertainment industry, and I don't think it's very good to be linked with your software company."

Li Bufan was really surprised by Liu Yuting's words. This gift was not small, after all, Tian Tian Reading is worth more than 10 billion yuan.

However, since he had already agreed before, it was not good not to agree, and besides, Huanyu Film and Television also had half of his shares.

Finally, he thought that since Liu Yuting was already his woman, what did it matter to be generous to his woman.

"Okay, no problem, who told me I'm your good husband!"

"Wow, hubby is so good, love you, kiss kiss."

"I love you too, baby. Hehe, since the night is still young, shall we do it again?"

"Ah, oh, okay. But, I have something to do tomorrow."

"Tingting, what's the matter tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow I have to go to the Bureau of Commerce to get the business license for Huanyu Film and Television.

These past few days, I've been busy setting up Huanyu Film and Television. Unlike a certain big boss, who has the secretary do things when there's something to do, and xxx when there's nothing to do, humph humph."

"Oh, is that so, hehe."

...

The next day, Liu Yuting obtained the business license for Huanyu Film and Television and rented an office building near the Zhi Gao Software Building for office use.

Since the two buildings are both in the University Science Park in Jiang City and are very close, Liu Yuting ran to Li Bufan's Chairman's office and acted as a temporary secretary.

At this time, Liu Yuting was sitting on Li Bufan's lap, holding Li Bufan, and blowing a gentle breeze into Li Bufan's ear, whispering.

"Hubby~~ I have already obtained the business license for Huanyu Film and Television.

When will you acquire Tian Tian Reading? I'm waiting to promote a group of people from Tian Tian Reading to be the heads of various departments in our film company.

Now the company office building has been rented, it's just two blocks away from here, the office building with a KFC next to it downstairs.

But now there is no one in the company, only the two of us. Come and play with me when you are free~~"

Li Bufan was greatly aroused by Liu Yuting's teasing and wrapped his arms around Liu Yuting.

"Mmm, I will come to your place to spoil you when I am free.

But when you are free, you should also take the initiative to come to me."

"Mmm, okay.

Li Bufan, what about the cooperation agreement between Zhi Gao Software and Huanyu Film and Television that you mentioned before?

Have you drafted it? Let me see it."

"This is of course already prepared.

You stand up first, sit properly, I'll find the information."

Then Li Bufan picked up Liu Yuting from where she was lying in his arms and let her sit steadily beside him.

Li Bufan found the terms he had drafted in his spare time before. The specific agreement is as follows:

Party A, Huanyu Film and Television. Party B, Zhi Gao Software.

Party A now entrusts Party B to fully produce the special effects in its film and television dramas. Both parties will establish an exchange department to supervise the smooth progress of the cooperation.

Among them, the cooperation is divided into two major categories. The first category is the production method for ordinary movies.

That is, Party A first completes the preliminary filming work in reality and hands over the post-production and special effects processing to Party B.

1. Party B will work with Party A to find a third party as a notary to provide an estimated special effects budget under the current requirements.

2. Party B shall complete the stipulated tasks with quality and quantity within the stipulated time.

3. If Party A changes the requirements temporarily in the middle, it needs to negotiate with Party B in advance. Only after both parties agree can the requirements be changed.

At the same time, Party A needs to pay additional compensation for lost work and special effects production fees, and the deadline will be postponed accordingly based on the time required for the actual requirements.

4. After completing the post-production special effects, Party A needs to review it within three working days.

5. After the review is completed, if there are no errors, Party A needs to pay the corresponding amount to Party B within seven working days.

If there are parts that need to be modified, and if it is due to Party B's error, Party B will modify it for free and reduce the corresponding amount.

If it is Party A's additional requirement that was not involved in the original requirement, both parties shall fulfill their responsibilities according to Article 3 mentioned before.

This first type of agreement is actually very similar to the contracts signed between many producers and commissioned special effects production companies, both of which pay based on the labor hours for special effects production.

As for the second type, it is film and television dramas filmed using unconventional methods, that is, through computer synthesis.

In this case, it is completely different and has brand new agreement clauses:

1. Party A provides Party B with a piece of material, including the plot of the story, scenes, descriptions of important characters, the background of what happened, etc.

Among them, facial data of the protagonist can be replaced according to certain requirements for intelligent face swapping.

The main material is a complete script. And Party B will produce based on the information provided by Party A.

2. During the production process, Party A shall not arbitrarily interfere with Party B's production progress.

If interference is required, the supervisors of both parties will adjust the work as appropriate.

If Party A changes too much, even completely revising the script, then Party B has the right to increase the price without an upper limit until both parties reach a satisfactory level.

3. Regarding the cost after the production is completed.

Since most of the work is completed by Party A, and Party B involves fewer filming personnel besides screenwriters, supervisors, and external cooperation departments.

Therefore, the minimum cost starts at 100 million yuan, with no upper limit.

The suggested cost is 20% of the box office revenue. The maximum cost shall not exceed 35% of the box office revenue. (This is because, in China, the box office revenue split between the producer and the cinema is between 4.5:5.5 and 5.5:4.5.)

These are the main terms regarding the cooperation and development of film and television dramas. Li Bufan has already written them down on paper.

Li Bufan showed it to Liu Yuting for her to check.

Liu Yuting thought for a moment, then nodded, feeling it was a pretty good agreement.

Liu Yuting looked at the second point and found it very novel. She wondered, wouldn't Zhi Gao Software lose money with such an agreement?

You should know that some Hollywood blockbusters burned hundreds of millions of us dollars on special effects alone, yet the box office was dismal, not even breaking even.

If they followed this agreement, under the premise that the box office didn't sell well, Zhi Gao Software would have a high possibility of losing money.

But once it sold well, both parties would benefit.

Thus, she was very curious. Looking at Li Bufan, she pointed her right index finger at the second type of cooperation clause, looking puzzled.

Li Bufan understood that she didn't understand why he would set such a clause.

In fact, for Li Bufan, he had two "ultimate weapons".

One was a smart conversion software that used the script to convert it into models and special effects. Well, let's temporarily call it "Aurora Reversal".

And the other one was the special effects production tool that had been heavily promoted recently, Aurora Special Effects Software.

With these two tools, honestly, borrowing a phrase from another Ma Zong among the internet giants:

Standing at the eye of the storm, even a pig can fly.

That's right, this is what Li Bufan believed. With these two tools, not to mention the low cost of server rendering, the human production time would be greatly reduced, and efficiency would be significantly improved.

Therefore, Li Bufan was so confident that as long as the script was fine and could smoothly pass the review of the State Administration of Radio and Television, then there would basically be no problem.

The final box office might not be a huge hit, but it would definitely recoup the costs and make a profit.

Thus, Li Bufan showed Liu Yuting the magic of "Aurora Reversal", and then demonstrated the Aurora Special Effects, the Artificial Intelligence Assistant.

At this point, Liu Yuting's heart surged, full of confidence, and she was very optimistic about the future prospects of the two companies, feeling very excited.

Then, she couldn't help but hug Li Bufan and said sweetly in his ear.

"Mmm~~ Husband, you're amazing!"

......

Two days later, good news came from Bu Changzhuo.

Zhi Gao Software acquired Tian Tian Reading from Tencent Group at a price of 19.3 billion, a premium acquisition.

Meanwhile, the offshore company located in the Cayman Islands, Brilliant Star, had successfully reached a cooperation agreement with Tencent Group, with a transaction amount as high as 9.8 billion us dollars.

Finally, except for 100 million us dollars given to Brilliant Star as a white glove intermediary fee, the remaining 9.7 billion us dollars were transferred to a secret account opened in Switzerland.

In other words, the funds in the company account suddenly decreased by 19.3 billion us dollars, leaving less than 15 billion us dollars.

However, Li Bufan didn't take it to heart, because he believed that as long as he had more than one billion us dollars, he could completely recover and rise again at any time.

And now he still had 4.3 billion us dollars left in his China personal account, and 9.7 billion us dollars just received in the Swiss bank secret account, so together he still had 14 billion us dollars in personal disposable funds.

After Tian Tian Reading was acquired, there were voices of decline in the market.

Everyone was not optimistic about Zhi Gao Software, and at the same time, they didn't understand why Tencent Group sold off a subsidiary for the first time.

You should know that Tian Tian Reading was the copyright provider for many of their games. Now that they directly sold it all out, aren't they worried about being choked by Zhi Gao Software later?

In fact, Ma Dage had already thought of this, but he wasn't worried either, because even if they were choked, the maximum loss would only be those few mobile games.

Furthermore, they had already squeezed enough money from players through these mobile games.

And the Smart Mutual Translation they obtained, when applied to Micro-Speech later, would unleash unparalleled power.

This was the key to the group's further advancement and could not afford any mistakes.

So, as for what was more important, only the real high-level executives knew.

However, some media outlets seemed to have discovered the unusual transaction items announced by Tencent Group.

That's right, those media outlets found that Tencent Group placed a 9.8 billion us dollar order with Brilliant Star, and the product name was Brilliant Mutual Translation.

And they reached a 19.3 billion us dollar acquisition agreement with Zhi Gao Software.

This couldn't help but make people suspect that there was something fishy going on.

The media began to contact the customer service of both companies.

After the customer service reported it layer by layer, Li Bufan and Ma Dage had a pleasant conversation on the phone again, and both parties would deny any connection between the two transactions.

Just like that, both sides flatly denied it. Zhi Gao Software stated that it was unclear about the translation technology of Brilliant Star, and did not know its origin, but it was unrelated to Zhi Gao Software.

Zhi Gao Software only sent an acquisition team to Tian Tian Reading, and the other party gladly accepted the acquisition.

And Tencent Group stated that after testing, the translation level of Brilliant Star had reached the industry ceiling, close to Zhi Gao Software's Smart Mutual Translation product.

They also stated that they would embed this function into their Micro-Speech to allow global users to enjoy fast, borderless communication services.

Finally, regarding the acceptance of Zhi Gao Software's offer to acquire Tian Tian Reading.

It was because they felt that the importance of Tian Tian Reading to the group was no longer that significant, and Zhi Gao Software offered a very sincere price, so they agreed to the acquisition.

Just like that, both sides knew well in their hearts, but on the surface, they drew a clear line between Smart Mutual Translation and Brilliant Mutual Translation.

Then the media outlets felt dizzy, unable to figure out what was going on.

Only some media outlets seemed to have found the truth and wanted to report relevant content, but they were refused by their editors.

Are you kidding? Those big companies are not something you can just "slander". They will sue the small newspaper you work for in court, and he doesn't want to retire early.

And the media outlets of the big companies were already warned in advance not to dig into their secret cooperation.

Instead, they began to promote that Micro-Speech might go out of China and officially enter the foreign market. Now is not too late to buy stocks, and there will be a lot of room for growth later, with very broad prospects.

Affected by this news, the market value of Tencent Group rose by 4 percentage points, while Facebook, located on the other side of the Blue Star, saw its market value decrease by 3 percentage points.

Zuckerberg, far away in California, felt as bad as if he had eaten shi after hearing this news, feeling cheated.

Then he called Li Bufan and began to complain that he didn't follow martial ethics, didn't keep his word, and would give Zhi Gao Software a legal subpoena.

Li Bufan didn't care, thinking, how could you take all the benefits for yourself?

As a Chinese, you still have to support China companies.

"Mr. Zuckerberg, did you misunderstand something?

Our agreement stipulates that I cannot spread Smart Mutual Translation to companies other than Facebook, but we also don't know where Brilliant Star's translation software came from.

Do you dare to guarantee that it wasn't leaked from your side?

I don't believe that besides giving it to the Facebook Technical Department, you didn't give it to other departments or the consortium behind you."

This instantly left Zuckerberg speechless, because he did exactly what Li Bufan said.

And in fact, no one knew if someone would risk being blacklisted by others and secretly copy and sell the software.

So, after a while, Zuckerberg said helplessly.

"Okay, Li. You win.

But I hope this is the first and last time.

Otherwise, you will face the wrath of the consortium behind us."

"Hey, buddy, don't be so serious.

Think about it, after cooperating with us, hasn't your company's market value increased by 20% compared to before? Isn't this the best proof of our cooperation?"

"It's not 20% now, but 15%, damn it, it dropped just yesterday."

"Ahem... don't mind that, it will go up.

It's normal for the market to have ups and downs. If it keeps rising, the bubble will be too big and it will be difficult to digest."

"Hmm, you're right.

But I still hope this situation doesn't happen again in the future. Alright, goodbye."

"Slap... beep beep beep...."

Zuckerberg had already hung up the phone.

Li Bufan, however, sneered in his heart, Hehe, Facebook, Facebook, let you swagger for a while, wait and see how I will surpass you in the future.
