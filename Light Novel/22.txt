Chapter 22: The Secret of Special Effects Videos



The next morning, alpha notified Li Bufan that Aurora Special Effects Software had been improved and was ready for release.

Li Bufan acknowledged this and once again gathered everyone, distributing the Aurora Special Effects Software for them to take back and test.

In this meeting, everyone was not as downcast or dispirited as usual.

Their faces were filled with joy and excitement.

It was evident that they were already aware of the impact of the special effects video circulating online and were very willing to take on the assigned task.

After the meeting, everyone began installing the software. Since the company's internal network environment was used, the software did not require payment, so they could operate it directly.

Initially, they all felt that the software was a bit complex and different from other special effects software on the market, and they weren't sure how to operate it.

However, after someone casually said a few words, triggering the primary Artificial Intelligence Assistant in Aurora Special Effects—Aurora—things became easy and simple.

Then, people spread the word, and everyone began to become familiar with and master the usage of this Aurora Special Effects.

In the morning, when Li Bufan told Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong that he had actually produced the special effects video, both of them looked as if they had seen a ghost.

This made Li Bufan feel a bit awkward, but he explained that he had a lot of talent in this area.

He had dreamt about it at night and worked on it during the day, completing the production of these special effects.

Li Bufan told them that he had learned about a team of foreign friends who had developed a special effects software, and he felt it was excellent, so he bought the software they developed.

This software was the predecessor of Aurora Special Effects, and then Li Bufan modified and improved it to get the current Aurora Special Effects.

He also explained that the current Aurora Special Effects was not yet perfect, and many functions needed to be modified and added, and officially handed over the software to the Software Development Department to improve this software.

At this point, everyone seemed to feel much more normal, but they were still very surprised. When did Li Bufan make foreign friends? How did they not know?

In fact, Li Bufan also understood that if he continued like this, one day, people would discover the trick.

He planned to hand over as much as possible to the company team in the future.

If it was truly impossible to complete, he would find a fictional overseas Organization or a so-called foreign friend to act as a shield, which could at least slow down the risk of exposure and prolong the time before being exposed.

Soon after, the special effects video was released on the company's official website, and at the same time, instructions on how to produce the special effects video were also released below, asking everyone to look forward to the company's second product, Aurora Special Effects.

Afterward, Li Bufan made corresponding explanations below his personal Weibo account and the company's Weibo.

"Everyone, actually, the 30-second video that sparked heated discussion among netizens is not real; it is not, as some netizens said, a precursor to the arrival of Aliens.

It is a trailer for our company's second product—Aurora Special Effects—which is about to be launched.

That's right, this video was produced by our company using the most advanced Aurora Special Effects Software.

This video was accidentally leaked by our employees, and we deeply apologize for the negative impact it has caused to the outside world.

Currently, the product is in the internal testing and improvement stage and cannot be shown to the public.

Therefore, we hope everyone can give us some time, and we will also bring you a brand new world.

At the same time, to prove that it was made with our company's software.

We have already posted a video on our official website showing how to create these special effects. Please give us your feedback.

We believe that in a short time, everyone will be able to use this special effects software to create the beautiful world you imagine.

Finally, thank you all for your understanding and support.

Choose Zhi Gao Software, choose a better future. See you next time."

Soon after, everyone discovered this announcement, and then the word spread. Only then did everyone know that it was an advertisement for a special effects software in China.

Then they checked the company's official website and found that it was indeed produced through a brand new special effects software.

So, everyone started liking and commenting under the announcement.

"Sure enough, I said it was a promotional video. It seems I was right. Hahaha."

"Although this is fake and shattered my starship dream, I am still very happy.

I am very happy that China can have a large company comparable to Industrial Light & Magic in special effects production. From now on, China will have one less industry that is controlled by others."

"That's right, Zhi Gao Software is great! I support you!"

"I am an employee of Industrial Light & Magic. I think your company's product is indeed very excellent, and I have to admire it.

However, thinking about this, I am both sad and happy.

I am sad because, due to this software, we may be laid off.

I am happy because this software was created by our countrymen. I am very happy that our countrymen can strive hard and become industry leaders."

"When will this software be released for public beta testing? And what is the price?"

"What other functions does this product have? What are the advantages and disadvantages compared to existing special effects software?"

...

Soon after, new trending topics were born, #Zhi Gao Software# Aurora Special Effects, starting to appear on the headlines.

As if responding to the call initiated by Zhi Gao Software, film production companies both in China and abroad began to officially announce their plans to cooperate with Zhi Gao Software.

Even Hollywood abroad began to join in the fun, stating that if the conditions were suitable, they would not mind using Aurora Special Effects to produce Hollywood blockbusters.

The release of this news made many special effects software companies in the industry feel as if they were facing a formidable enemy, with everyone shouting "The wolf is coming."

At the same time, relevant stock indexes in the industry began to fluctuate as a result.

The most obvious ones were those listed companies that relied on special effects software as their main source of profit.

Their stock prices began to shrink significantly. In China, one company directly hit the daily limit down, while the decline abroad even reached 30% to 40%, with the market value nearly halved.

This caused panic selling. After learning the facts, some shareholders were not optimistic about the future prospects of these companies and expressed that they would not continue to hold the stocks of these companies.

At this time, several companies joined forces and held an online meeting to discuss how to jointly deal with the Aurora Special Effects Software that was about to enter the market.

Finally, they all stated that they would work together to develop a brand new software based on surpassing Aurora Special Effects.

Then, these companies began to announce this news. Affected by this, their stock prices began to rise.

And Li Bufan, who was watching all this behind the scenes, just smiled and remained silent.

He thought to himself, wanting to create software that surpasses Aurora Special Effects is nonexistent; only Zhi Gao Software can create works that surpass itself.

As for those affected companies, I have to say sorry. It is because you did not keep up with technological development. It is the era that chose us, and it is the era that abandoned you. You cannot blame others.

At this time, the employees using the special effects software began to operate Aurora Special Effects in full swing, conducting various aspects of testing.

To Li Bufan's surprise, there were actually a few people who found several areas that could be improved and proposed several novel ideas.

This made Li Bufan sigh with emotion, the power of the masses is great.

The wisdom of the ancients, "Many hands make light work," indeed did not deceive me.

Fortunately, although these ideas were very good, the areas that needed to be modified were not large.

Therefore, Li Bufan decided to leave it entirely to the Software Development Department to complete.

Soon after the company's announcement was released, many media outlets began to leave messages on it.

They inquired whether they could get an interview opportunity and conduct a special interview on Aurora Special Effects.

This matter was first reported to the New Media Operations Department, and then reported layer by layer to CEO Bu Changzhuo.

And Bu Changzhuo was not sure if accepting the interview would disrupt Li Bufan's plan, so he contacted Li Bufan.

"Brother, I just returned to the company not long ago, and there are already so many things.

I have to say, you are really good at stirring things up."

"Uh, Second Brother, don't say that. What do you mean I'm too good at stirring things up? I'm creating revenue for the company.

Don't worry, your year-end bonus will not be less.

By the way, did you contact me just to complain, or is there something else?"

"Hahaha, Brother still understands me. There is indeed something.

I learned that many media outlets want to inquire about our second product and seek opportunities to interview us at the company.

Tell me, should we refuse or accept?"

"Hmm, that's a good question. How about this, let's not rush for now.

Don't say no, and don't agree immediately.

Just say that the company will hold a second press conference in a few days. This press conference has nothing to do with Facebook anymore, haha.

At the press conference, we will announce the detailed parameters of the Aurora Special Effects Software and our company's next strategic plan.

Just issue a statement to the outside like this, then collect the media outlets that want to sign up for the press conference, and then filter them out.

As for the time of the press conference, let's tentatively set it within ten days, because I am not sure of the specific time right now.

But what is certain is that I will notify you in advance and communicate with you. Then you can represent me and give the speech."

"Hehe, how can I be so presumptuous? Won't I be stealing Chairman Li's thunder?"

"Tsk tsk. Don't think I don't know that you like to show off on stage, I'm giving you the opportunity, and you're still being stubborn.

Alright, actually, the main reason is that a tall tree attracts the wind. If I appear in front of the screen often, it doesn't feel very good."

"Uh, Brother.

So, you're using me as a shield?"

"Haha, Second Brother, you could say that.

Others want to be but can't. What, you don't want to be?"

"No, no, no, Brother, I want to, I want to.

It is my good fortune to shield Brother from the wind and rain."

"Alright, stop talking nonsense. Just give the orders like this and let those media outlets wait for now."

"Okay, then I won't bother you. Brother, goodbye."

"Hmm, goodbye."

Li Bufan hung up the phone and smiled.

In fact, what Li Bufan said to Bu Changzhuo on the phone was indeed the truth.

Because Li Bufan felt that if he exposed himself multiple times, he would be like a celebrity in the future, living under the spotlight.

No matter where he went, he would have to wear a mask, followed by a few burly men, and his words and actions could not have the slightest mistake.

Otherwise, this would not only cause netizens to criticize him but also damage the company's reputation.

Therefore, Li Bufan decided to let his good Brother, Bu Changzhuo, represent him as the company's CEO in front of the stage, run errands and work for him, and also let him accept news interviews.

However, Li Bufan also thought of a problem, a problem that already existed.

That is, many people in the company did not know about Li Bufan's existence, but they knew a lot about Bu Changzhuo's existence, which made Li Bufan feel a little lost and vigilant.

However, Li Bufan believed that his good Brother would not betray him, so he gave him as much power as possible with not much supervision.

And alpha would conduct a certain degree of supervision over those important high-level executives on a daily basis.

But rather than surveillance, it was more like giving them a mobile Artificial Intelligence Assistant that could automatically call for help and contact Li Bufan, ensuring their safety.

Li Bufan believed that even if they knew afterward that they were under a certain degree of supervision, they would not be unhappy.

After all, with such high salaries and bonuses, no one would have trouble with money, right?

As for the press conference mentioned by Li Bufan on the phone, Li Bufan had another plan.

This plan will be carried out in the next few days, and only after it is completed will the press conference be held.

This matter was the inspiration that sparked during the discussion with Liu Yuting before, the film and television industry, as the existence of the production side.

For this, Li Bufan already had some ideas and arrangements.

However, he planned to start implementing it in two days.

And two days later is the date Li Bufan arranged for the official launch of the Aurora Special Effects Software.

Aurora Special Effects Software, as a highly efficient special effects production software, needs to be deployed on PC operating systems.

For this, Li Bufan had alpha compile and export three software programs, respectively deployed on Microsoft's Windows, Apple's Mac OSX, and the public Linux OS.

And now, what Li Bufan is waiting for is the crystallization of everyone's wisdom.

It has to be said that the imagination displayed by multiple people is powerful enough.

Among them, one person proposed a method that could greatly improve the software's operating efficiency and increase the company's profits:

Add cloud computing assistance function.

To put it simply, this function is to use the company's surplus computing resources to help these small companies or studios.

Help them with computationally intensive operations such as rendering special effects images, and transmit the results back to the client to load the calculation results.

And each software comes with a certain amount of computing resources. In this way, although it will "lose" at first.

But when they get used to the powerful rendering function of cloud computing and return to their own computers to perform rendering work, they will pay to use the company's cloud computing service because they cannot bear the long waiting time.

In fact, for Li Bufan, the benefits of this are huge.

The 128-bit quantum computer that Li Bufan possesses can be said to be the sum of the computing power of most servers and supercomputers around the world, and countless times more, and the power consumption is not large.

Therefore, for Li Bufan, computing resources are the cheapest and most inexpensive resource.

So, Li Bufan immediately had alpha develop a plugin. The function of this plugin is to statistically monitor the consumption of cloud computing resources, communicate with the server, and transmit the parameters of the rendered results.

After Li Bufan obtained this plugin, he handed it over to the Software Development Department and informed them that he had actually been working on the development of this function for a long time, and it was just completed.

Then, Li Bufan watched them perfectly embed the plugin into Aurora Special Effects, then left and returned to his office.

In this way, Li Bufan began to conceive and ponder the company's future plans.

And the outside world, due to the grand and magnificent sci-fi special effects, was very excited about the upcoming launch of Zhi Gao Software's second product, Aurora Special Effects, hoping to see sci-fi blockbusters produced with this special effects software soon.

After learning that Zhi Gao Software was going to hold a second press conference, the onlookers were very much looking forward to it and demanded to form teams to attend.

However, the company could not accommodate so many viewers. After the company's official explanation, they said they would watch the live broadcast the whole time and tip as appropriate.

And the media outlets were all eager, setting up their cameras and heading to Jiang City, preparing for the upcoming press conference.
