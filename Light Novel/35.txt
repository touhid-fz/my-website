Chapter 35: Becoming Stronger: Advanced Gene Enhancement Fluid



Seven days after the assassination attempt, Li Bufan was still unconscious.

Although the bullet had been removed after treatment, his internal organs were continuously deteriorating, and his condition was worsening day by day.

The Doctor finally had no other options and had someone notify Li Bufan's family, issuing a critical illness notice.

After Liu Yuting heard about it, she felt helpless and drove with Zhang Qian to the villa Li Bufan had bought for his parents.

Actually, after they became a couple, Li Bufan had once brought her home, but she only stayed for lunch and then left.

Fortunately, the car's navigation still had a history record, so they could find the location of his parents' home.

Sitting in the car, Zhang Qian was very nervous because she was about to meet the parents soon and didn't know how to interact with Li Bufan's parents.

Liu Yuting seemed to notice this as well and cheered her up.

"It's okay, don't be nervous. Just say you like Li Bufan very much, and say we are his girlfriends."

"Ah, is that really okay?"

"Hmm, what? You don't want to?"

"Hehe, it's not that, I'm just a little embarrassed and afraid the elders won't accept it."

In fact, a few days earlier, Li Bufan's parents had seen the news in Jiang City about their son being assassinated and hospitalized.

At that time, they felt the future seemed bleak; they didn't want to see a white-haired person burying a black-haired person.

For this matter, they also specifically called the Police Station and confided in a Police Officer.

When the Police Officer heard it was Li Bufan's parents, he felt that as parents, he could still understand them very well.

Therefore, the staff told Li Bufan's parents to remain calm and said that Li Bufan would definitely recover, asking them to have confidence and live and rest well in their daily lives.

"Knock knock knock..."

Liu Yuting and Zhang Qian had already gotten out of the car and were knocking on the door.

The parents heard someone knocking, checked the surveillance, and found it was two girls. One of them they recognized, it was Liu Yuting, whom Li Bufan had brought home not long ago.

So, they opened the door.

The two said in unison: "Hello Uncle, hello Auntie."

"Hello, who is this? What are you here for today?"

After the assassination attempt, both parents had become a bit paranoid and had a sense of distrust towards the people around them.

"Hello Auntie, I am Zhang Qian. I... I am Li Bufan's girlfriend, just like Liu Yuting."

The parents were stunned, not expecting their son to be so flirtatious.

The Father looked at the two girls, both of whom could be considered stunning beauties, and they both claimed to be his son's girlfriends, which was incredibly hard to believe.

Liu Yuting pulled Zhang Qian and explained: "Actually, this is nothing. After all, as long as both parties are willing, it doesn't really matter. After all, our ancestors even had three wives and four concubines."

Only then did the parents nod: "Then why are you here today?"

Liu Yuting took out a critical illness notice from her bag, hesitated a little, but still handed it over.

As soon as the parents saw the critical illness notice, both of their hearts couldn't take it.

The Mother fainted directly, while the Father was slightly better and quickly told Liu Yuting and the others to go to the bedside table in the largest room on the second floor to get medicine.

Hearing this, the two didn't even change their shoes and ran upstairs directly. After finding the medicine, they quickly handed it to them.

After a while, the four people sat on the sofa, and the Mother had also recovered.

"Sigh. This is truly a sin. I don't know what I did in my past life, why is my son being punished?" the Mother sighed.

The parents also shook their heads, looking melancholic.

Liu Yuting and Zhang Qian, each holding the parents' hands, slowly spoke.

"We believe Li Bufan will be fine. Afterwards, we will find the best Doctors on the entire Blue Star. If Western medicine doesn't work, then we will find the best Chinese medicine practitioners in the country to help. We believe there will be hope."

"Sigh, hope is slim. I didn't expect things to turn out this way."

At this moment, Zhang Qian looked at the gloomy parents and then did something that surprised them.

Zhang Qian knelt down before them.

"Li Bufan once helped me, and now I want to help him. Dad, Mom, from now on, I am your daughter, and you are my parents. If he is gone, you still have me and Liu Yuting. We will stay with you and take care of you in your old age."

Seeing this, Liu Yuting also knelt down and called out "Dad, Mom".

The parents were overjoyed and wept, pulling them up.

"Good, good, good. Li Bufan has such good girlfriends like you, and we are very happy for him. If he knew we had two daughters, he would surely leave this world peacefully and be happy for us in heaven. However, how great it would be if he were safe and sound. A family together, happy and harmonious, how wonderful."

"Perhaps good people are blessed by heaven, and a miracle will happen to Li Bufan. Dad, Mom, don't be too sad. Come with us to the hospital. Let's go see Fan together. Maybe, after we arrive, he will wake up."

"Good, good, good."

And Li Bufan, who was at the center of the incident, was still sleeping.

And deep within his mind, a voice was sounding.

"Sigh... I'll help you this one time. I hope that from now on, you will have the awareness of being born in hardship and dying in comfort, an indomitable will, a resilient body, and the heart of a strong person."

Several days later.

"Where is this? Why does it feel so empty?"

"This is deep within your mind. I am the embodiment of the system. Your consciousness has been pulled here by me."

"I remember I was hit by multiple bullets. Am I going to die?"

"Yes, you are going to die. Are you scared?"

"Yes, I'm scared. What do you think will happen after death?"

"Hehe, I hope you never find out."

"Then how much lifespan do I have left?"

"Perhaps not long, perhaps a very, very long lifespan. This depends on you."

"What do you mean?"

"Okay, in reality, with such severe injuries, it should have been impossible to survive. However, I helped you. Your body is now completely intact, and all the damaged organs have been repaired."

"Why did you save me?"

"Hehe, because every system has three emergency rescue opportunities. Or, you can consider them three extra lives. Now that the near-death condition has been triggered, you only have two opportunities left. And the cost of this treatment is half of your current points. That is to say, for this treatment, you spent 67500 points, leaving 67500 points."

"What? So expensive? That's worth 675 billion us dollars!"

"That's right. Therefore, the system suggests that while improving technology, you should not forget to improve your physical fitness. This is very important, very important! This is also why in both missions, there were tasks that required taking Gene Enhancement Liquid to complete. Such obvious hints, yet I didn't expect you to not notice."

"Okay, fine, I was wrong. Then what is the most expensive Gene Enhancement Liquid I can afford now? I want to become stronger. I don't want to experience the feeling of death again."

"Very good! It is recommended that the system embark on the path of a true strong person instead of just wandering around in the Newbie Village. Of course, this is also a path of no return. Is the system ready?"

"What do you mean? What preparation?"

"If you agree to embark on the path of a strong person, the system will undergo an upgrade. From now on, your missions will no longer be at the Newbie difficulty level. They might be at terrifying nightmare levels. Of course, generally, the mission difficulty will be acceptable, allowing the system to have an adaptation process.

But are you sure you want to do this? The path of a strong person is very dangerous and also very exciting. You are very likely to face dangers such as assassinations, bombardments, and nuclear annihilation. Of course, the mission rewards will also be very generous."

"What the hell are you talking about? What kind of missions are so terrifying?!"

"Of course, they are missions on the path of a strong person. As a strong person, you need to have an aura that looks down on the world and should not fear anyone."

"Uh, this is a bit too difficult for me. I'm still struggling with the Newbie missions.

Can I do this: I'll inject the Gene Enhancement Liquid first, but the system won't upgrade and will continue to keep the Newbie mission difficulty?"

"Hmm, yes. However, within three years at the latest, the system will automatically upgrade. At that time, please be prepared, system, to embark on the path of a strong person and head towards the starry sky and the great sea."

"Okay, then tell me about the Gene Enhancement Liquid."

"Okay. Based on the current system progress, which is the Newbie stage, plus the current technological level of Blue Star. Currently, the highest level of Gene Enhancement Liquid the system can use is the Level 1 superior gene enhancement fluid, priced at 50000 points. After taking it, you will have a lifespan of 500 years. Your body will be immune to all diseases, impervious to swords and guns, and armor-piercing bullets will not be able to harm you at all."

"Okay, good. Can you inject it into my body now?"

"Yes, are you sure you want to purchase and use it? Similarly, the Gene Enhancement Liquid also requires consuming a massive amount of energy. It needs approximately 100 standard energy bars, which is 3 billion kilojoules of energy, to replenish the energy required for the tearing and repairing of the body during the gene enhancement process.

However, it is recommended that the system directly use 1 superior energy bar, worth 10000 points. The system can help you digest the energy and store it within your body."

"What? Tearing the body?"

"That's indeed correct. Because the enhancement process is actually a process of reorganization and upgrade. First, some cells will be enhanced first, and the internal gene fragments will also be optimized. Telomeres will be extended even further.

The cell membrane of the skin will be strengthened to an incredible extent. And various organs in your body will undergo various transformations because of this. Your muscle fibers will break, then degenerate and dissolve, while new muscle fibers will split and regenerate. Afterwards, your muscles will be composed of brand new muscle fibers. And you will possess incredibly terrifying strength."

Of course, this power might be too immense for you to control well temporarily. You will need to exercise your body to experience and control this change."

Also, your body will undergo a certain degree of deformation to better suit the exertion of human strength. At the same time, your height and weight will also increase."

Finally, gene enhancement is a gradual process. There will be significant changes in a short period after injection, and changes will continue to occur for a period of time in the future. For example, your height will get taller, your weight will get heavier, your strength will get greater, and so on."

"Okay, then. I am absolutely certain. I will immediately purchase the superior gene enhancement fluid and the superior energy bar, and then help me take them."

"Okay, system. The system purchased Level 1 superior enhancement fluid X1, consuming 50000 points. The system purchased Level 1 superior energy bar X1, consuming 10000 points. A total of 60000 points were consumed, leaving 7500 points. The superior enhancement fluid has been injected, and the superior energy bar has been released into the body. The estimated body enhancement time is 12 hours."

"Okay, good. Why can't I control my body from within my mind now and can't wake up?"

"This is a protective measure taken by the system because the system was previously close to death. If the system chooses to wake up now, you will feel the pain of your body tearing. Are you sure you want to wake up?

At that time, you will cry out due to the pain in your body, and your cries might lead medical staff to mistakenly think that your body is undergoing further pathological changes and inject you with sedatives or other agents that inhibit physical evolution, turning a good thing into a bad thing."

Of course, you can also wait 12 hours to wake up, during which you will not feel the pain caused by your body tearing."

"I see, then let's do it after 12 hours."

Little did they know, at this time, people in the hospital were panicking.

Because, just now, Li Bufan's heart rate accelerated, exceeding 200 beats, which greatly surprised the medical staff.

Then the experts went to the intensive care unit and saw the four people waiting beside him.

"Doctor, how is my Fan?"

"Hmm, the situation is very strange. After examination, his skin wounds have healed, and his heart rate has started to accelerate. The oxygen demand from the oxygen mask has begun to increase significantly."

So, we are not sure if this is a sign that he is about to wake up. We have been practicing medicine for so many years and have never seen such a strange thing."

Liu Yuting, who was nearby, was very excited to hear about these incredible phenomena.

She thought that Li Bufan seemed to have an unusual ability to monitor others, and perhaps other abilities as well, such as possessing a recovery ability different from ordinary people.

Well, Liu Yuting even thought this might be Li Bufan's superpower.

But the result of her analysis was also very close to the correct answer.

So, she walked up to the Doctor.

"Doctor, I think Li Bufan might be recovering. I hope you will cooperate well, don't disturb him, and don't give him any extra injections like sedatives or other agents to slow down his heart rate."

That Doctor was very confused, looking at Liu Yuting.

"Oh? Why do you say that? Does he have some secret?"

Liu Yuting shook her head.

"I don't know. But I know that his condition seems to be improving now. Since that's the case, why do the opposite? After he recovers successfully, he might tell you himself."

The Doctor thought about it and felt it made sense, but found it hard to accept the fact that Li Bufan suddenly recovered, believing he must have some hidden secret.

"Alright, I'll talk to them."

Subsequently, the Doctor told the other Doctors about Liu Yuting's speculation and the unusual changes in Li Bufan's body. The other Doctors looked solemn.

"If we obtain the secret of his recovery, how many people will benefit from this? The few of us will definitely be able to get a Nobel Prize because of this."

"That's right. Since that's the case, let's draw 10ml of blood for research, how about it?"

"Will 10ml be too little? Not enough?"

"Then let's draw 20ml first. Anyway, he's still hospitalized, so we can totally do 10ml a day, for sustainable development."

"Haha, good idea."

Little did they know, because of this tube of blood, they would later face deadly danger, being relentlessly pursued by United States intelligence personnel and various large consortiums.
