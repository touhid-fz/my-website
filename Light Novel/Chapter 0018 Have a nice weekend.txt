Chapter 0018: Have a nice weekend



Today was Saturday, so Liu Yuting didn't have to go to the company.

... At this point, omitted ...

By the time Fan and Liu Yuting woke up from bed again, it was already eleven in the morning.

They each took a bathroom to shower, wash up, and get dressed.

By the time they were ready to leave, it was already 11:45.

Just like that, Li Bufan took Liu Yuting's hand and walked downstairs shoulder to shoulder with her.

After returning the room card and checking out, they walked out of the hotel.

"Gugulu... gulu..."

At this moment, Liu Yuting's stomach rumbled. Liu Yuting quickly covered her stomach with both hands and looked at Li Bufan somewhat shyly.

"Sorry, my stomach is rumbling against my will."

"It's okay. Are you hungry?"

"Mm, yes. We didn't eat breakfast, and it's already noon."

"Alright. I remember there's a Wanda Plaza nearby. Let's go there.

After lunch, we can shop around the mall in the afternoon."

"Mm, okay."

They quickly had lunch at noon, and in the afternoon, he took her shopping around the mall.

Li Bufan saw that she had been browsing for a long time but still hadn't found any clothes she liked.

"Tingting, what kind of clothes do you like? I saw many clothes in those stores.

Is it that you think the price is too expensive and you're reluctant to buy?

How about this, it's my treat. Let's go back to the clothing store you lingered in the longest."

"Ah... No, that's not it. I... I just think..."

Li Bufan understood that Liu Yuting was actually just shy, so with the aura of a domineering CEO, he didn't wait for her to finish speaking and pulled her hand towards that clothing store.

Just like that, they shopped for another half an hour, and by now, Li Bufan's hands were full of shopping bags, big and small, carrying many things.

At this moment, Liu Yuting's face was beaming with a happy smile as she looked sweetly at Li Bufan.

"Fan~ You spent too much today, I feel so embarrassed."

"Haha, it's okay."

"Oh right, I still don't know what position you hold?

Besides the day we had dinner together, why haven't I seen you before?"

"Me? I guess I'm in a technical role.

What about you? What's your position?"

"Mm, I see. I work in market operations, my salary isn't as high as you technical people."

"That's not necessarily true. My salary might not even be as high as yours, haha."

"Ah, no way. Then you spent so much money today. Let's not do this in the future, okay?"

"Wow, Tingting, my dear, you're really considerate of me, I'm very happy.

But don't worry, our department has bonuses, and meals and drinks can be reimbursed by the company."

"Pfft.... Fan, isn't it not so good to use public funds to chase girls? Won't your supervisor fire you?"

"Haha, if he dares to fire me, it's more likely I'll fire him. Don't you worry!"

"Mm, okay then. I'll listen to you."

Li Bufan then looked at the large and small shopping bags in his hand and couldn't help but smile wryly.

"Tingting, let's not shop anymore, okay? There are too many things, I'm a bit tired, haha.

If there's anything you want to buy, we can come back tomorrow or later."

"Mm mm, okay."

"I don't know. Where do you want to go?"

"I want to be with you."

"Mm, me too. What a coincidence, hehe."

Just then, Li Bufan's peripheral vision caught the large LED advertisement inside the mall, which was for the recently well-received "wandering blue star."

So, Li Bufan pointed at the LED advertisement with one hand.

"Tingting, how about we go watch "wandering blue star"?"

"Mm, okay. Then where do we put our things?"

"We can store the things in the lockers at the cinema, let's go see if there are any lockers there."

Indeed, when they reached the entrance of the cinema, they saw a row of lockers.

Li Bufan chose the largest locker and then stored the shopping bags one by one, keeping the ticket for easy retrieval later.

Li Bufan noticed that the next showing of "wandering blue star" was 35 minutes away, which was perfect timing, not too late, and they should still be able to get good seats.

So, Li Bufan held Liu Yuting's hand and quickly walked to the ticket counter, lining up.

"Hello, I'd like two tickets for the showing of "wandering blue star" in 32 minutes."

"Hello, Mr. and Madam. Okay, Mr., which two seats would you like?"

"Seats in the middle, slightly towards the back rows, two seats together."

"Alright, Mr. Take a look at these two tickets, seat 8 and seat 9 in row 7. Is that okay?"

"Mm, yes, that's fine."

After buying the tickets, Li Bufan and Liu Yuting sat down in the rest area to relax for a bit.

They started chatting with each other.

"Fan, why do you want to take me to see this movie?"

"Uh, well, there's no other reason, really. It's just that my friend told me this movie is very good. I heard the special effects are comparable to Hollywood blockbusters from the United States, and the 3D effect is particularly good.

Also, the plot is good too. After all, it's a science fiction work by Liu Cixin, so the quality is quite high."

"Ah, oh, I see. Okay then, I'll watch it with you."

"Mm, Tingting is so good. Oh right, we've been shopping for so long, are you a bit thirsty, a bit hungry?"

"Mm, it seems so."

"Mm, then let's buy something to eat and drink.

Oh, right, I think the cinema doesn't allow bringing in food and drinks bought elsewhere.

I remember once, I went to see Avengers, and because I was in a hurry, I bought two burgers and a cup of juice from KFC nearby. I hadn't eaten them yet when I went to the cinema, ready to have my ticket checked and enter.

As luck would have it, the ticket checker saw the KFC bag in my hand and refused me entry.

She demanded that I either finish eating before going in or store the food here at the cinema and go in to watch the movie first, then come out to eat after the movie.

Think about it, I hadn't eaten dinner that night, and then I had to watch a movie for about 3 hours. My stomach rumbled many times during the movie, making the people around me look at me like I was a clown, which was very embarrassing.

Then when I came out after the movie, it was already past midnight, the KFC was already cold, and I could only eat it like that. It was utterly chilling and exhilarating, I wonder if Sprite needs this advertisement."

"Wow, I didn't expect you to have such an experience, that's so funny.

I'm sorry, I'm not laughing at you, but I'm just amused by your interesting experience.

Well, in that case, let's buy food and drinks at the cinema. I haven't had popcorn in a long time."

"Mm mm, okay. Then let's go buy popcorn.

What about drinks? Do you want juice or cola?"

"Mm, let's go with the happy water for fat people. Although I don't usually drink cola, iced cola with popcorn and watching a movie is still very happy."

"Mm, okay then. I'll have the same as you."

Li Bufan walked to the food counter at the cinema.

"I'd like a large popcorn and two large cups of cola."

"Alright, Mr. That will be 46 rmb in total. Please show your payment code."

After paying, Li Bufan held the popcorn in his right hand, bent his left arm, holding one cup of cola, and then held another cup of cola in his left hand. His movements were somewhat like a clown, but also a bit stiff.

Li Bufan quickly walked to Liu Yuting's side.

"Tingting, help me out, my hands aren't enough. You hold the cola."

"Oh, haha, okay."

Then the two of them sat back in the rest area and then went to the restroom one after another to wash their hands with hand soap, so they could eat the popcorn with their hands later.

At this time, there were only ten minutes left until the movie started, and ticket checking had already begun.

Li Bufan and Liu Yuting lined up together, had their tickets checked, each took a pair of 3D glasses, and walked towards Screening Room 3.

The entire screening room was quite empty, there weren't many people, probably because the movie had been released for over a month and many people had already seen it.

Just like that, Li Bufan and Liu Yuting chatted and laughed, eating popcorn and drinking cola while waiting for the movie to begin.

......

More than two hours later.

The lights in Hall 3 turned on, signifying the end of the movie.

They put down the trash from what they had eaten and drunk, as there would be staff to clean up, so they walked out of the cinema empty-handed.

The two of them first went to the rest area to sit down and discuss the sad or tragic plot points in the movie.

Afterward, the two of them talked about topics outside of the movie plot.

"What do you think of the special effects in this movie?"

"I think it's still a bit behind popular science fiction blockbusters from Hollywood, such as Interstellar and Avengers, but it has already set a precedent for China science fiction films.

When I watched the trailer, I thought it was just average, but when I watched it in the cinema myself, I was amazed. It's really good."

"Yes, I heard that this movie is called a milestone in China science fiction films by everyone online.

I heard that the special effects alone were produced by four companies together, two of which are joint ventures between China and foreign countries. Even so, it took 8 months to complete the post-production effects, and it cost a total of 240 million rmb to complete."

"Wow, Fan, you know so much."

"Hehe. Of course, after all, I'm your boyfriend, it's always good to be excellent."

"Mm-hmm. Fan, I'm so lucky to have met you."

"Meeting you is also my luck, little darling Tingting."

Afterward, since it was almost dinner time, Li Bufan stood up, took her hand, and took out the big and small bags of clothes from the locker.

Since they had bought so many things, Liu Yuting finally felt embarrassed and invited Li Bufan back to her rented room.

The room wasn't big, less than 10 square meters, but it was decorated very warmly.

There were various motivational quotes on the wall, stacks of books on the desk, and bags of snacks on the coffee table.

"The room is a bit small, you don't mind, do you?"

"I don't mind, it's okay."

I see that the other rooms in this house seem to be occupied by other people. What's going on?

Oh, I'm sharing with others. The other two rooms are both occupied by girls.

However, I didn't know these people at first. They are all long-term tenants, and I joined in the middle.

Oh, I see. So, when you are alone, do you feel unsafe? After all, the key to the front door is in the hands of several people.

Well, a little at first, but later everyone met and introduced themselves briefly. After that, we would also greet each other when we met. After a long time, it's fine.

Uh, I have an idea. I wonder if it's possible.

What idea? Just say it. It's fine. Anyway, I may not necessarily agree, hehe.

I was thinking, how about you live with me?

I'm well-off recently and planning to buy a house. How about you help me arrange it?

Ah, this... Isn't this too fast?

If my parents knew, they would scold me.

Then what should we do?

Then... Then I'll tell my parents the truth, that I found an excellent boyfriend and want to live with him?

Yes, yes, that works too. When you have time later, I'll bring you home to meet my parents. They will definitely be very happy.

Ah, this... Isn't this too fast? I'm not ready yet.

Well, I see. Then there's no rush. Let's just date for now and talk about it after a while.

Mm, okay.

So, you agreed? To live with me?

Li Bufan thought of the happy life ahead and couldn't help but swallow, giggling foolishly.

This made Liu Yuting hold back the words she originally wanted to say. She rolled her eyes at him and was shy for a long time, unable to say a single word.

Finally, she seemed to understand something, then nodded at Li Bufan.

Mm, I agree. But, will you not want me in the future?

After all, I'm not particularly pretty, nor very smart, and sometimes I'm forgetful when doing things.

How could that be? I promise you, as long as you don't fail me, I won't fail you.

I want to be with you forever, through thick and thin, for all eternity.

Mm, I promise you, I will interact less with other boys in the future, only professionally, not chatting privately.

I also want to be with you, forever and ever. I love you, Li Bufan.

Although we've only been together for two days, I think you are really a very good person. Not only are you excellent, but you are also very considerate. With a boyfriend like this, I am already content.

Mm, thank you. I love you too, Liu Yuting. You are beautiful, and I like it very much. You are very cute, and I like it very much too.

...

The next day, Li Bufan took Liu Yuting to the sales office of a villa area he had previously favored.

Mr. and Madam, hello. Are you here to view properties in Quiet Valley?

Yes, I remember contacting your Manager Wang on the phone before.

Oh, you had an appointment. Please wait a moment, I'll help you find our Manager Wang.

After a while, Manager Wang hurried over and walked up to Li Bufan.

Esteemed guest, hello. May I ask who you are?

My surname is Li, Li Bufan. We talked on the phone. Do you still have the largest unit?

Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I've been too busy recently and forgot.

I remember now, we did contact each other. You wanted our most prized possession, the Overlord Villa.

No rush, please follow me. Let's first look at the aerial model and 3D panoramic view of this villa.

Mm, okay.

At this moment, Liu Yuting was full of doubts, thinking, why are we coming to Quiet Valley community?

This is the rumored rich area, over 100,000 per square meter, and these are all villas.

Oh my god, the manager just said it's the largest unit, so it must be at least 500 square meters.

Oh my god, how rich is Li Bufan? Since he's so rich, why does he come to work at the company? I understand him less and less.

But why do I feel like I'm being sugar-daddied? It seems I'm quite happy, it's so strange.

Yuting, Yuting, what are you thinking about?

Just then, Li Bufan tugged at Liu Yuting's sleeve, waking her from her internal monologue.

Tingting, look, how is this layout? In addition to the basic configuration, it also comes with a helipad, a swimming pool, a pond, and a garden.

Wow, the area is too big! How much does this cost?

Manager Wang was very puzzled. On the phone, he said they weren't short of money, so why did the girl next to him have such an expression now?

However, he didn't ask and instead said.

Madam, this Overlord Villa is our most prized possession. Our Boss originally kept it for his own family to live in, so it should be non-saleable.

But your husband offered a high price, which made us very tempted, and our Boss made the decision to reluctantly part with it and agree to sell it.

This villa has a total area of 1468.88 square meters. The extra garden and pond are considered gifts.

According to the agreement your husband made with us before, it is being purchased at twice the price of surrounding villas.

That is to say, 200,000 per square meter, with a total value of approximately 300 million rmb.

Hearing the numbers 200,000 per square meter and 300 million rmb, Liu Yuting was shocked inside. She looked at Li Bufan, feeling truly lucky, her face filled with a happy smile.

Li Bufan looked at the slightly smiling Liu Yuting and asked in a deep voice.

Tingting, what do you think of this villa layout? Do you like it?

Liu Yuting answered without hesitation, "I like it, I like it very much."

Seeing her so happy, Li Bufan was also very pleased, so he looked at Manager Wang.

Manager Wang, I can pay the money.

But I would like to ask, are the villa's interior, furniture, and appliances all ready?

Seeing Li Bufan speak so decisively, Manager Wang was overjoyed. Suppressing his excitement, he said:

Mr., since our Boss originally planned to live in it, we carefully selected both the exterior and interior decoration for this villa.

As for the appliances, furniture, bathroom supplies, and even kitchen supplies inside, they are all fully equipped and produced by international first-tier brands. You can rest assured about the quality.

Therefore, you can completely move in with just your bags.

Mm, alright. Go prepare the contract. Once it's ready, we can swipe the card, sign, and stamp.

Then, I can live in it today, right?

Mm, yes, Mr..

Manager Wang was ecstatic. This commission was much higher than his annual salary and he was very excited.

So, he quickly instructed the staff nearby to take good care of Li Bufan and Liu Yuting, and then, humming a tune as he walked, went to the office to prepare the contract.

After swiping the card and signing the contract, Li Bufan received the key to the villa's front door and a string of keys for various rooms.

Li Bufan held Liu Yuting's hand and went into the community to find the Overlord Villa, which was located in the center, the tallest, largest, and most unusual one.

Entering the villa, the two strolled around, exploring the entire villa, and then each chose their favorite room.

Tingting, let's just live in one room. Why choose separate ones?

Fan, there are so many rooms here, what should we do if we don't live in them?

Uh, we can switch rooms every day, how about that?

Or some rooms can be used for playing instruments and singing, or for working, or for reading and studying, how about that?

Mm, alright then, I'll listen to you.

Hehe, that's good. Let's take this largest bedroom.

So, what should we do next? Should we go to bed and rest for a while?

Of course, we're moving! My clothes, books, and so on are all in the room I rented.

Mm, alright then. It seems today is destined to be a busy day.

Then we need to hurry. Oh yes, later, on the way, we can buy some packing boxes and bags at a courier point on the road to make packing and moving easier.

Mm, mm, that makes sense. Then let's go back. I also need to talk to the landlord and tell her I'm not renting anymore and ask for a refund of the deposit.

Mm, okay. Let's go.

...

I have to say, girls really have a lot of things. The room looked neat and clean, and there didn't seem to be much stuff.

Only after tidying up did they realize that it wasn't a little, but a lot.

Things were piled up in some corners, such as hooks on the wall where coats could be hung.

Storage boxes filled with miscellaneous items could be placed under the bed.

Several large cardboard boxes on the wardrobe were stacked almost to the ceiling, storing various odds and ends.

Helplessly, the two were busy for half a day, and time flew by.

It was lunchtime, and they had only finished tidying up a little over half, still a distance from being fully packed.

So they ordered takeout from a pizza place and continued working.

Finally, they finished tidying up around three or four in the afternoon.

At this time, Li Bufan was already sweating profusely from exhaustion.

He quickly called a moving company to send a truck, then sat on the balcony, fanning himself and panting heavily, resting well.

Finally, when the two arrived at their new villa home, it was already 6 pm.

They didn't immediately open and sort the large and small bags of luggage but instead each took a shower to wash away the sweat from a busy day.

Finally, the two were surprised to find packaged food in the refrigerator, and it hadn't expired yet.

So they took out the food and feasted in the living room.

Then they started tidying up and sorting the items they had moved.

In the end, because there were too many things, they couldn't finish tidying everything up.

Finally, the two fell asleep in each other's arms due to exhaustion.
