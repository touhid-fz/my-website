Chapter 38 Return



Dad, Mom, Liu Yuting, and Zhang Qian, it's been a long time since we last met.

I know you have many questions and many guesses.

But, there are some things I cannot tell you, and even if you knew, it wouldn't do you any good.

All you need to know is that I'm back this time and won't be leaving anytime soon.

I will steadily develop the company.

As for Zhang Qian, I understand and accept your feelings.

I'm very happy that you can join our big family.

These past few days, how many security guards or bodyguards died because of us, and how many were severely injured?

How did you arrange their affairs?

Liu Yuting, you should have the most say in this matter.

“Hmm, that's right.

A total of 7 people died, 4 were severely injured, and there were too many others with minor injuries.

For the families of the deceased, we paid 10 million as compensation.

The severely injured received 5 million, and those with minor injuries received at least 100,000.

In total, we paid around 110 million.

The other three were greatly surprised upon hearing this number.

They hadn't expected so many casualties, nor had they expected Liu Yuting to be so generous.

Li Bufan nodded, feeling very relieved.

“That's right, those who died or were severely injured for us and their families should be properly taken care of.

This money is a lot for ordinary families, but it is still not enough to compensate for the spiritual trauma caused by the death of the family's breadwinner.

In the future, if there is an opportunity, our company should allocate resources to them.

If the conditions aren't too different, they can also come to work at our company.

This can be considered a form of solace for them.”

Li Bufan's tone shifted, and then he opened his eyes wide, looking very angry, and slowly spoke.

“Ultimately, it's still because our strength is shallow and we don't have much influence.

If we had thousands of security personnel, would others dare to provoke us?

I doubt it.”

Liu Yuting nodded, then seemed to think of something and raised a very important question.

“Li Bufan, you are absolutely right.

However, China absolutely does not allow private companies to operate security companies of such a large scale, unless they are officially controlled.”

“That's right, but who said we were going to open a company in China?

I plan to register in the Cayman Islands, with the headquarters set up abroad, recruiting outstanding Chinese from various countries overseas, and dispatching ace bodyguards to protect us.

As for most people, I plan to send them to war-torn areas like Somalia, allowing them to be tempered by war in the form of mercenaries.

Those who survive will be elites.”

His parents looked at Li Bufan, who seemed to have become cold-blooded, feeling a bit of fear, and said in a deep voice.

“Li Bufan, isn't this too cruel?

It's peacetime now, and you're sending them to fight on the battlefield.

People will die.”

“Do you want to die?

Haven't enough people died outside the villa these past few days?”

Li Bufan looked at his parents, very impolitely and somewhat rebelliously retorted.

His parents were immediately speechless, a little angry, but also a little embarrassed.

They had to admit that Li Bufan was right.

Especially Mr. Li, who had served in the military for 4 years when he was 18.

Even after retiring, he still couldn't forget those exciting years in the army.

He understood very well that only those who have been tempered by war are elites.

And the elites among the remaining elites, who will protect them, will definitely be much, much safer than ordinary security guards.

“Dad, Mom, stay in the villa with peace of mind during this time.

Later, when your son is capable of protecting you, you can go out, okay?”

His parents nodded.

Although they didn't want to admit it, they had to say that they were indeed a burden to Li Bufan at the moment.

Li Bufan looked at Zhang Qian, smiled and stroked her head, and slowly spoke.

“Zhang Qian, since you've decided to be with me, you are very likely to be targeted by others, even assassinated.

Are you mentally prepared for this?”

“Li Bufan, I'm ready.

I love you.

If one day I can stand in front of you and take a bullet for you, I will step forward without hesitation.”

“No, don't be like that.

Because you should be the ones I need to protect, not the other way around.

Alright, perhaps you don't believe me.

Come, let's go to the villa's gym.

I'll show you the strength I currently possess.”

Everyone felt very strange, but also a little excited and looking forward to it, and walked to the gym with Li Bufan.

The gym had a lot of exercise equipment, including treadmills, barbells, pull-up bars, etc.

Among them, weightlifting was the simplest and most effective way to demonstrate strength.

Li Bufan saw that there were 4 pieces of 100KG, 4 pieces of 50KG, and 4 pieces of 25KG weights in the room, and put them on the barbell.

Li Bufan lifted the barbell with a light grip of one hand, and then performed various movements with it in his hand, even managing to hold it perpendicular to his body at a ninety-degree angle.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Mr. Li had a bit of an urge to try, and attempted to lift it with both hands, but there was no reaction at all.

“It's really true, son, who exactly are you?

Could it be that some immortal transmigrated into you before you died?

How come we didn't know you had this ability?”

“Cough, cough... Dad, Mom, I am Li Bufan, your son.

Alright, I only gained this ability after I was discharged from the hospital, otherwise I wouldn't have almost died back then.

As for how I got it, I can't say, but what I can say is that you will also have the same strength as me in the future.

This potion is too rare.

If calculated in terms of monetary value, it would probably cost close to 100 billion US dollars per injection.”

“That expensive?”

“Hehe, yes.

So, you must keep this secret well, okay?

Anyway, you need to know that from now on, our family won't have to worry about food or clothing.

While we may not be rich enough to rival a nation, we will certainly be wealthy in one area.”

“Okay, okay, we didn't see anything just now.”

“Now, do you believe in my strength?”

“Absolutely.”

“Very good.

Oh, Zhang Qian, you can work at Huanyu Film and Television with Liu Yuting from now on, okay?

Liu Yuting, you should also help her, okay?

You two should be like sisters, understand?”

“Yes, we will.”

The two girls replied in unison.

“Then I'm going out to take a look at the company.

It's been a long time since I've been back.

Stay in the villa during this time and don't wander around.

If anything happens, you can contact me directly on Micro-Speech.”

Liu Yuting took out her phone and wallet from her pocket and handed them to Li Bufan.

“Li Bufan, this is your phone and wallet.

I brought them back from the hospital.”

“Hmm, thank you, Liu Yuting.

Just in time, I haven't gotten a phone number or replaced my bank card and ID card.

Alright, I can use them.”

“You're welcome.

Li Bufan, goodbye.

We'll be waiting for you at home, okay?”

“Okay, see you in a bit.”

After speaking, Li Bufan opened the window and jumped out.

Everyone looked at Li Bufan's quickly disappearing figure with envy.

They looked at each other, then nodded, acting as if nothing had happened.

Li Bufan hopped and jumped, and with his running, he quickly arrived at the top of the Zhi Gao Software Building.

Then he jumped and entered the Chairman's office.

Then Li Bufan went out the door and went to the adjacent CEO's office, knocking on the door.

“Please come in.”

Li Bufan pushed open the door and saw Bu Changzhuo processing documents with his head down, seemingly very busy.

“Oh, Bu Changzhuo, how have you been lately?”

Bu Changzhuo was stunned when he heard the voice, then overjoyed.

He had finally seen the backbone, and a stone in his heart seemed to have fallen.

He couldn't help but smile bitterly.

“Brother, you're finally back.

We were so worried about you.”

“Has anything happened recently?

You look like you've lost a lot of weight.”

“Sigh.

Don't even mention it.

The prison is simply not a place for people to stay.

Our company was raided by the army a while ago.

They stole a lot of important information and destroyed a lot of servers and internal facilities.

They also arrested several of our important executives and threw them in jail, interrogating us about whether we knew the company's secrets.

Not to mention I didn't know, even if I did, I wouldn't do anything to betray you, Brother.

Later, after a few days, the relevant departments said that it was caused by Japanese spies who had been hidden in China for many years, and that this incident was not done by the authorities, and they apologized to us.

However, I think there might be a tacit meaning in this.

They wanted to test the strength of our company, and then obtain internal company secrets, and finally catch all the deeply hidden spies in one go.

It's simply killing three birds with one stone, it's too terrifying.”

Li Bufan seemed to sense Bu Changzhuo's fear.

“So, you don't want to be the CEO anymore?”

Bu Changzhuo nodded.

“It's not just me, Wang Huadong also doesn't want to accept this kind of grievance and pain anymore.

Of course, we are very willing to work with you, but it's really too dangerous.

We might not even know how we die one day.”

“Sigh, I'm sorry.

All this time, I've neglected your feelings.

How about this, you call Wang Huadong over too, and we can all talk about it.”

“Okay, I'll call the office.”

“Hello, who is this?”

“Wang Huadong, come to my office.

I have something to discuss with you.”

“Oh, okay, I'll be right there.”

After a while, Wang Huadong saw Li Bufan sitting nearby, and seemed to understand that it should be related to Li Bufan.

“Brother, I knew you were alright.

It's really great to see you.”

“Alright, I've heard about the situation you've encountered, and I'm very sorry about it.

It was me who didn't protect you well.

And now, I have a few suggestions, listen up.”

“First, you continue to stay in your current positions, and I'll give each of you 5% of the shares.

However, as company executives, you are still at high risk.

I will send a few bodyguards to protect each of you.”

“Second, you leave the company.

This way, you won't have access to company secrets, and others will seem to lose value in finding you.

However, there is still risk, because someone might threaten me through you, which would be even more troublesome.”

“Third, you no longer serve as company executives, but as ordinary employees, and I will also give you 1% of the shares.

The advantage of this is that I can easily protect you, and you can avoid being targeted by hostile forces at this stage.”

“What do you want to choose?”

“To be honest, if it weren't for the experience of the past few days, I would definitely choose the first option, but I'm truly scared now.

That deep sense of powerlessness is very uncomfortable.

So, I want to choose the third option.”

“Me too, I'll choose the third option.

However, I majored in chemistry, which is actually not very related to company affairs.”

Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong spoke one after another.

Li Bufan looked at his two brothers and nodded.

“Okay.

Bu Changzhuo, you will give up the position of CEO from now on and start as an employee in the software development department.

I will have Wang Zixu, the head of the software development department, tutor you, which will also improve your abilities in the field of computers.

Wang Huadong, I will specifically hire some mentors from the chemistry and materials departments for you.

Then you can study and conduct experiments with them and start your research work.”

“Okay.”

“No problem.”

“Then let's do it this way, Wang Huadong, you hand over your work to the person with the best performance below you and let her be the head of the secretarial department.

After giving the instructions, come back to my office.

Bu Changzhuo, come with me.”

“Oh, okay.”

Bu Changzhuo followed Li Bufan to the Chairman's office, feeling very confused.

“Bu Changzhuo, you've been with me for so long, and I haven't given you anything good.

Today, I want to give you and Wang Huadong a gift.”

“What gift?”

“Gene Enhancement Liquid, which will allow your physical fitness to rival that of top special forces and can extend your lifespan, giving you 200 years of life.”

“This... how is this possible?”

“Hehe, nothing is impossible.

Otherwise, how did I wake up?

Alright, all you need to know is that this potion is worth tens of billions of US dollars.

Do you want it or not?”

“This... I want it, hehe.”

“Hmm, very good.”

Then, Li Bufan purchased 2 bottles of Level 1 Elementary Gene Enhancement Fluid and 10 energy bars from the system, spending a total of 5000 points, leaving 22500 points.

Then, he had the system place the items in the safe.

Just like that, Li Bufan pretended to fumble around and found the key to the safe.

After opening the safe, there were two tubes of blood-colored potion and 10 energy bars inside.

To be honest, when Li Bufan injected it back then, he hadn't paid attention to its color.

He found that it wasn't a liquid that wriggled like life like the Brain Domain Development Potion, and immediately felt that it was much easier to explain.

Li Bufan picked up a tube of potion and 5 energy bars and said to Bu Changzhuo.

“Bu Changzhuo, the red one is the Gene Enhancement Liquid, and those 5 are energy bars, used to replenish the energy consumed when the Gene Enhancement Liquid strengthens your body, to prevent deficiency and weakening of the strengthening effect.

You drink the Gene Enhancement Liquid first, and then eat all 5 energy bars.”

Bu Changzhuo looked at the magical potion, nodded, picked it up, and poured it directly into his mouth.

“Cough, cough... It hurts so much.”

“Endure the pain.

Now, take the energy bars immediately.”

“Cough, cough... Okay.”

Li Bufan saw that Bu Changzhuo had already taken it, poured him some water to drink, then picked him up and placed him flat on the sofa.

“It still hurts so much...

It feels like ants are chewing all over my body, a bone-piercing pain.”

Li Bufan was also a little awkward, thinking that he hadn't experienced that kind of pain back then, and didn't know what to do.

“Then try your best to close your eyes and try to sleep.

Think that when you wake up, you'll be a superhero.”

“Uh... Alright, I'll try.

I'll just endure this pain.”

Two hours later.

“It doesn't hurt anymore, and there's a feeling of expansion all over my body.

It seems to be full of strength.

I feel like I could punch a hole in the ground.”

“Hmm, it seems to have taken effect.

Go take a shower.

Wang Huadong should be here soon.”

Another three hours later.

At this time, Wang Huadong and Bu Changzhuo were sparring with each other, quickly honing each other and familiarizing themselves with their strength.

“Alright, stop.

That's enough.

I see your fists are bleeding.”

“Hehe...

It's bleeding, and it can stop very quickly.

It's simply amazing.”

“Yes, yes, I feel like with my physique, going to the Olympics would be a piece of cake.”

“Cough, cough... You must not show any abnormalities in your daily life, understand?

This is your last trump card.

The later it is revealed, the greater your chances of survival.

Since you are ordinary employees now, those people probably won't make things difficult for you anymore.”

“Hehe... Understood, understood.

We won't let anyone know about this.”

“Hmm, by the way, Bu Changzhuo, let's hand over the CEO's work.

I plan to give the position of CTO to Wang Zixu later.

I see he's doing very well in the software development department.

I'll manage the company from now on.

I want to see which monsters dare to come and die.”

“Okay.”

Finally, Li Bufan understood the current state of the company and also took over the connections in Bu Changzhuo's hands.

At the same time, he gained experience in company management.

For example, how to register the company in the Cayman Islands, as well as some precautions and relevant policies, Li Bufan learned all of them.
