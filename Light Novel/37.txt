Chapter 37 September School Season



Unconsciously, Li Bufan had already stayed in the fishing village for some time.

These days, he would help the old village chief with farm work during the day, and at night, he would accompany him and the old men and women of the fishing village, chatting together, carefree and very comfortable.

Just one morning, when Li Bufan was about to do farm work, he heard the system's notification sound in his mind.

"Ding, September 1st, a new month has arrived.

As the system, you need to work harder."

"Newbie Task (3), you must choose one and only one task from the following three.

The task list is as follows:

1.

【Run 500 kilometers within three hours】.

Additional task requirements: You can rest halfway, but you cannot use any means of transportation.

Task success reward: 5000 points.

Task failure penalty: Unable to use this system for one week.

Task difficulty: Medium.

2.

【Master your own strength within one week】.

Additional task requirements: You must be able to hold chopsticks normally to eat.

Task success reward: 5000 points.

Task difficulty: Medium.

3.

【Complete 5000 push-ups within one hour】.

Additional task requirements: You have three attempts.

Task success reward: 5000 points.

Task failure penalty: Unable to use this system for one week.

Task difficulty: Medium.

The final interpretation right of the task belongs to this system.

"

Li Bufan didn't expect that after the last task, a new task would come so quickly.

Time really flies.

After seeing these three tasks, Li Bufan felt that the difficulty was similar, so he chose the second task.

Because Li Bufan had been working every day and eating a lot of food these days, his body continued to develop, and his strength increased day by day.

However, regarding the subtle aspects of strength, Li Bufan's progress was not significant.

At most, he could hold some iron tools without damaging them.

But going a step further, it was still a bit difficult to not damage bamboo chopsticks.

This morning, Li Bufan hurriedly finished the farm work, then asked the village chief for some chopsticks, saying he wanted to practice to control his strength.

Then Li Bufan started training.

Five days later, Li Bufan could finally hold chopsticks without breaking them.

By the seventh day, Li Bufan could finally eat with chopsticks like a normal person.

At this time, the village chief was also very pleased.

He patted Li Bufan and said that he had made great progress.

Li Bufan, however, smiled bitterly in his heart.

If people knew that the dignified Chairman of Zhi Gao Software Company couldn't use chopsticks for a period of time, it would definitely shock countless people.

"Ding, system has completed the task - 【Master your own strength within one week】, rewarding 5000 points.

Account balance is 12500 points."

"Ding, system has over-completed the task by 2800% - 【Publish a paper within two weeks】, rewarding 1000 points, with an additional reward of 14000 points.

Account balance is 27500 points."

Just as Li Bufan was eating, two consecutive notification sounds rang in his mind.

Li Bufan's movement paused, and the chopsticks broke again.

The village chief looked at Li Bufan and shook his head, thinking that this young man was good in every way, but he was just too wasteful of chopsticks.

"Young man, are you alright?"

After hearing the village chief's words, Li Bufan shook his head and sighed.

"I'm fine, Village Chief.

Sorry, they broke again."

"It's okay, it's okay, I'll get you another one."

......

Li Bufan understood that he had stayed here long enough.

If he continued like this, he would definitely eat the village chief into poverty.

Furthermore, he could now control his strength quite well.

He just needed to continue training normally.

Also, he hadn't seen his parents for a long time and missed them very much.

Li Bufan thought for a moment and felt that the people in the fishing village had been very kind to him during this time, especially the village chief, who was even more kind and friendly.

Therefore, Li Bufan decided to leave this place.

However, before leaving, he would give the people of the fishing village some help within his capabilities.

......

After finishing his meal, Li Bufan rushed to a nearby town.

This town had a bank with an ATM machine next to it, where he could withdraw money at any time.

However, ATM machines have withdrawal limits.

Each bank card can make a maximum of 10 withdrawals per day, totaling no more than 20,000 yuan.

And Li Bufan left in a hurry and didn't find the clothes and wallet he had changed out of.

The clothes Li Bufan was wearing now were actually taken by Li Bufan from a few shops along the way.

However, Li Bufan still remembered the names of those shops and planned to repay double the amount later.

Helplessly, without a mobile phone, a wallet, or an ID card, Li Bufan seemed unable to withdraw money.

Finally, Li Bufan thought of a solution and ran to an Apple phone shop.

Fortunately, the shop staff didn't mind users playing with the phones in the shop; they seemed used to it.

Li Bufan logged into his Micro-Speech, saw countless 99+ messages, felt a bit disappointed, but still didn't reply.

Afterwards, Li Bufan opened the payment function of Micro-Speech and told the Boss that he had lost his phone and needed to buy a new one.

At first, the Boss was very impatient, but when he saw that Li Bufan still had millions of yuan in his Micro-Speech, he immediately became generous and told him to pick whatever he wanted.

Then, Li Bufan took the latest iPhone, paid for it, then logged out of Micro-Speech and cleared the data.

He turned on the new phone, logged back into Micro-Speech, looked at the messages inside, remained silent for a long time, and still didn't reply.

Afterwards, Li Bufan asked the Boss if it was convenient for him to withdraw money from Micro-Speech and offered to pay a service fee.

The Boss looked at Li Bufan suspiciously, thinking that he was very likely a scammer who had obtained someone else's account and password.

However, he thought that it would be foolish not to make money, and he had no grudges with money.

So he gladly agreed, but stated that Li Bufan would need to pay a 20% service fee.

Li Bufan was also speechless for a moment, but this money was truly insignificant to Li Bufan, who had seen big storms.

Finally, after Li Bufan transferred 1.2 million yuan to the Boss, the Boss took Li Bufan to the bank.

In the end, 100 bundles of 10,000 yuan banknotes were put into a safe.

This safe was a gift from the Boss, worth only a few hundred yuan, with no significant security features, mainly for convenient storage.

Li Bufan quickly thanked him, then took the safe and left.

The Boss looked at the 1.2 million yuan in Micro-Speech Pay and chuckled foolishly, very satisfied.

Meanwhile, Li Bufan was rapidly running and jumping through the jungle.

Soon, he arrived at the fishing village.

Among the 22 ordinary families in the fishing village, Li Bufan distributed cash ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 yuan based on the wealth gap.

Lastly, at the village chief's house.

These days, Li Bufan was very grateful for his care, so he directly placed the suitcase along with the remaining 500,000 yuan in the room where Li Bufan had previously stayed.

On top of the suitcase, Li Bufan placed a note.

"Hello, Village Chief, I am the young man, Li Bufan, who has been staying at your house, eating your food, and causing you trouble these past few days.

I apologize for the disturbance and am very grateful for these days.

There are some things I have to face now, so I have to leave the fishing village.

I haven't given everyone much, just 10,000-20,000 in cash for each household.

Although it's not much, it's my token of appreciation.

As for you, Village Chief, all the money I'm giving you is in this box.

Thank you for your kindness during this time.

Thank you, Village Chief, thank you, elders and fellow villagers.

Please take care, I, Li Bufan, am leaving today."

......

Today is Jiangcheng University's annual freshman orientation day.

On this day, the freshmen, full of joy, walked into the university campus and began their four years of study and life.

On this day, the Principal delivered a speech to all the freshmen in the gymnasium.

In his speech, he mentioned his hope that the freshmen would acquire knowledge, graduate successfully, and have a good future.

Finally, he mentioned Zhi Gao Software, this emerging Horned Beast enterprise, and praised Li Bufan and the other two.

However, the people below the stage whispered.

"I heard Li Bufan is dead, is that true?"

"No, he was just assassinated, maybe he's paralyzed now."

"Tsk tsk tsk... Too tragic, Senior is too tragic..."

"Why do I hear from my relative in the hospital that Li Bufan is very likely not a Human? I heard he has already fully recovered, and the relevant departments have sealed off the news."

"Wow, that's so interesting... Then is he an Alien or what?"

......

The Principal on the stage was also a little sad when he heard everyone discussing Li Bufan's matter. He thought for a moment, didn't continue reading the script, but paused for a moment, then spoke.

"Actually, I haven't met this student, Li Bufan, but he and I had a phone call. The content of the call was about borrowing our school's laboratory for a use, and I agreed at the time."

Do you know?

In the list of the latest accepted articles on the official websites of Science and Nature, he has nearly 30 papers that will be published in the magazines this month or in the following months?

That's right, this is the pride of our Jiangcheng University, and even China. He is a genius, a true genius.

Perhaps geniuses are always envied. You are right, he was indeed assassinated by an enemy country and is currently missing.

However, you must know why he is so important; it is because of his importance to the rejuvenation of China. They are already afraid, which is why they resorted to such underhanded methods.

In the future, there may be more Li Bufans among you. Tell me, are you afraid? Do you dare to climb the highest peak of scientific research, bring glory to China, and not fear the threats of enemy countries?"

"Not afraid, we dare."

The students below the stage didn't expect the Principal to face this issue directly and give an impromptu speech.

Everyone's enthusiasm and passion were completely stirred up by the Principal's words, and they were very excited.

......

And this video also sparked heated discussion on the internet.

"Jiangcheng University, well done! Li Bufan, well done! New students, well done!"

"The Principal is right! China's large population base is our advantage.

Among us, there will be more, even smarter geniuses than Li Bufan, who will emerge."

"China's rise is unstoppable, and enemy countries will surely hit a wall!"

......

The news of Li Bufan having 2 papers accepted by Nature was exposed again, further boosting the reputation of Jiangcheng University.

Some secret research institutions abroad, however, discovered that Li Bufan's method of producing new materials was very similar to the technological data in their laboratories.

Therefore, the relevant departments immediately reported the news.

After learning about it, the relevant personnel in charge of scientific research were very angry, but there was nothing they could do. They could only tell them to do a good job of confidentiality in the future and try to register patents in advance.

Thus, the situation in various countries continued to be turbulent, and they began to secretly compete again.

......

Li Bufan was walking alone by the sea at this time, looking at the messages Liu Yuting and others sent him every day, feeling very relieved.

Among them, Liu Yuting also explained Zhang Qian's matter.

"That's how it is. Zhang Qian wants to become my sister and be your girlfriend together in the future. And, we have already received the blessings of our Dad and Mom, oh.

That's right, we've already started calling your parents Dad and Mom, hehe. Don't leave us, oh. When are you coming back? We miss you so much, oh."

Li Bufan smiled knowingly. He was indeed not against Zhang Qian, and even had a little affection for her. Since the girls had no objections, he gladly accepted.

Li Bufan first found alpha on the internet through a secret method.

"alpha, I'm doing well, how are you? How has the family been recently, how has the company been? Tell me about it."

"Master, my respected Master, I finally see you, I missed you so much. I'm doing well, no one has found my quantum computer host yet, so I'm safe and sound.

As for the family, there are currently four people in the family: Master's parents and Master's two girlfriends. There are more than 20 security personnel and more than 10 armed plainclothes soldiers guarding the house nearby.

During this time when Master was away, there were 2 incidents of enemy spies infiltrating the villa. This resulted in the death of 4 of our security personnel and serious injuries to 2 security personnel, but all 8 spies were intercepted.

As for the company, Bu Changzhuo has managed it very well during this time, and all company operations are normal. Also, Huanyu Film and Television, because Zhang Qian also needed special protection, with Zhang Qian's consent, the lead actress has been changed, and the movie has started reshooting.

And some matters were handed over by Liu Yuting to the people below the company to handle, and she can completely assist remotely with work, basically without any problems.

Also, the company has suffered 1 armed attack and 1 surprise inspection in the past few days.

The armed attack was by some foreign forces who dispatched assassins to try to break through the company's defenses, wanting to forcibly enter the company and steal company secrets and technological data related to artificial intelligence.

The surprise inspection was ordered by a certain agent from Japan who had been secretly lurking in China for many years and became a high-level military official.

Under the pretext of investigating a criminal suspect, they forcibly entered the company and damaged servers and office supplies worth 28 million us dollars, while also copying all technological data, and then left.

But before leaving, they arrested Master's two good brothers.

It was not until several days later that the relevant personnel discovered it was the work of a long-lurking spy, and only then were Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong able to get out of prison.

Because of this, the company was in a state of panic. Fortunately, Bu Changzhuo announced in time that the company would issue a 1 billion yuan year-end bonus red envelope this year, distributing it to all employees up and down the company, everyone would get a share, and everyone felt a little relieved.

"Damn it, strength, I crave strength! This is simply too much bullying. I didn't expect Japan to be lurking so deeply, even the military and Police Officer departments are involved, it's too hateful!

If they hadn't been discovered, who knows if they would have occupied the entire country like a cuckoo taking over a magpie's nest in the future, it's too insidious and cunning."

"Yes, Master. After they were defeated in the war of aggression against China back then, many 

Hawk 

warlike elements voluntarily stayed behind, and began to live in various parts of China under assumed names.

They changed themselves into complete Chinese people, and even to show themselves, they would outwardly say they were defending China's interests and would oppose the relevant departments of Japan, but in reality, it was just a few harmless criticisms. Only at critical moments, when they received instructions and orders from the military, would they be activated. This is preparation for future invasions."

"Damn it. Forget it, these devils, let's see how I deal with them in the future. I will make them kneel and sing 'Conquer'!

Now, notify Liu Yuting and tell her I'm coming home, and ask her to open the window of the room."

"Okay, Master."

......

Liu Yuting was looking out the window, wanting to see Li Bufan's figure, but she hadn't seen anyone for many days.

"Beep beep..."

Liu Yuting found that there was a message on Micro-Speech, opened it, and was very excited. She quickly opened the window, closed the door, and then replied that she was ready.

After receiving the message, Li Bufan jumped from above the other villas towards the window of the room. With just a few jumps, Li Bufan entered the room.

Then he patted the dust off his body and picked up Liu Yuting in one go.

"My dear, I'm back, I've kept you waiting."

"Wuwu... Li Bufan, you're finally back, I thought you didn't want me anymore, I missed you so much, oh."

"How could I not want you, Tingting, you are my good baby, I missed you very much too."

"Mmm, then shall I call everyone over?"

"Mmm, okay, there are some things I need to talk about openly and honestly with everyone."
