Chapter 30 Brain Development Potion



Over the past two days, Li Bufan chatted a lot with alpha and completely understood the architecture and working mechanism of the translation model in Smart Mutual Translation.

However, for Li Bufan, except for the time spent on his graduation thesis, he had never come into contact with English papers, let alone knew how to write in English.

Therefore, he was quite troubled about how to write all of this on a dozen pages of paper.

Furthermore, a dozen pages of paper meant a total of at least several thousand, if not tens of thousands, of English words.

Although Li Bufan's English was indeed good, starting from scratch to write was truly difficult.

In one day, Li Bufan only completed the abstract and background introduction.

This greatly troubled Li Bufan, who thought, if it's like this, with such slow writing speed, how can he possibly obtain a large amount of points.

He wasn't even sure if he could complete the points required.

It was at this moment that Li Bufan thought of the first mission. At that time, Li Bufan thought that the first mission definitely required him to take the Genetic Enhancement Potion to complete it.

As for the second mission, which was to publish a paper, based on the current efficiency and progress, it could only be said to be barely manageable.

Therefore, would there be some potion that could improve this situation?

As soon as Li Bufan had this thought, he felt it was very possible and began to ask the system.

"System, is there any potion that can improve my learning and writing efficiency?"

"It is recommended that the system use the Brain Development Potion. After drinking it, it will initially improve the system's thinking organ, increase the complexity of thinking, and reduce the time consumed by the reflex arc.

Simply put, it can also improve the system's IQ.

The Brain Development Potion is worth 5000 points and can raise the system's IQ to the current physical limit, approximately an IQ level of around 300."

"What? 5000 points? How is it more expensive than the Elementary Genetic Enhancement Potion?

That is a divine medicine that can strengthen the body and increase lifespan. Why don't you just rob me?"

"Because, in the universe, Scientist means the upper limit of civilization level.

And Martial Artist means the highest combat power of a civilization's individuals.

From a civilization perspective, generally speaking, the value of a Scientist is undoubtedly the greatest.

Therefore, the Brain Development Potion is actually also the most valuable type of potion."

"As for why I don't just rob you? Because I cannot do that.

Because I abide by the supreme law of equivalent exchange and cannot forcibly take your points.

And the system, after completing the tasks I assign you, can also receive rewards, which is fair and just."

Li Bufan listened to the explanation, thought for a moment, and then nodded.

"Alright, then give me a Brain Development Potion."

"Okay, system. The system has purchased one Brain Development Potion, consuming 5000 points, leaving 135,300 points. Do you need it taken out now?"

"Mm, yes, bring it out and just put it on the table."

"Okay, system."

Just then, beams of light appeared, and countless blue and green particles began to aggregate, and then a potion resembling an oral solution appeared.

What caught the eye most was the liquid filled with green, which seemed to be alive, the liquid floating up and down, bubbling.

Then, Li Bufan picked up this oral solution and found that there were only six large characters on it: Brain Development Potion.

There was no production date, no expiration date, no manufacturer, a completely 'three-no' product.

Looking at the green liquid that seemed to flow like life, it made Li Bufan feel a chill and a bit hesitant to swallow it.

"System, what exactly is this? Why does it look like a living organism? Is it still alive? Are there any precautions for taking it?"

"System, don't worry. This is one of the most important parts of the Brain Development Potion.

That's right, this is a special organism, a life form that can live in space and autonomously absorb free Dark Energy, named 'Fengli'.

This type of organism is very common in the vast and boundless universe.

However, this has undergone some special processing and has been put into some special substances, and is now in a state of being neither alive nor dead.

If you wish, you can call it Schr√∂dinger's 'Fengli'.

In this state, it is most suitable for intelligent life forms to absorb.

System, after you take it, in this state, it will slowly evaporate, and the Dark Energy and special substances beneficial to brain development will directly act on your brain tissue.

During this process, you need to replenish enough energy to meet the energy required for brain modification.

If there is no energy, the cells in your body will rapidly decay, leading to a decrease in your lifespan."

After hearing this, Li Bufan felt a chill and was a bit unwilling, knowing it was a living organism.

And the system also mentioned the need for enough energy, did it mean to supplement with food?

But food is digested into glucose, and finally becomes the direct energy substance ATP, but this takes time, and he didn't know if it would be enough.

He should still consult the system.

"System, you mentioned enough energy, do I need to keep eating?"

"System, this is not recommended.

During brain modification, your brain will be in a relatively empty state.

At this time, any conscious action you take may have negative and irreversible effects on this process.

The correct way is to take the potion, and then take energy bars to supplement energy.

Afterward, quickly find a comfortable large bed, close your eyes, lie down, and rest well.

After waking up from a nap, you will become the smartest Human on Blue Star."

"Ah... okay. It is a bit troublesome. What are energy bars?"

"System, after taking the Brain Development Potion, you will need approximately 80 million joules of energy. It is recommended to take 3 energy bars.

Each energy bar contains approximately 30 million joules of energy and costs 100 points per bar, allowing the system to increase its energy reserve by 30 million joules."

"Uh, okay. Then buy 3 energy bars and put them on the table."

"Okay, system. The system has purchased 3 energy bars, consuming 300 points, leaving 135,000 points."

There was another flash of particles, and 3 energy bars lay quietly on the desktop.

Li Bufan picked up an energy bar and examined it carefully.

This energy bar was roughly the size of chocolate, but it contained a very sufficient amount of energy, which was quite incredible.

It might be due to compression, because Li Bufan could feel the weight of this energy bar was already close to that of light metal of the same volume.

Fortunately, in the Chairman's office, a large bed had been purchased not long ago, which was usually used for resting with Liu Yuting, and now it could be used.

Li Bufan carefully closed various windows and locked the doors and windows.

Then he took off his coat and sat on the bed.

In his left hand, he held a bottle of Brain Development oral solution, and in his right hand, he held 3 energy bars.

Li Bufan thought for a moment and decided to follow the system's guidance, opening the small bottle cap of the oral solution, then gritting his teeth and pouring it directly into his mouth.

After the green liquid was poured into his mouth, Li Bufan could feel that it was indeed a living organism, seemingly struggling, wailing, and then slowly disappearing.

Suddenly, inspiration struck him. He could clearly feel a sense of comfort, and his mind was clear, and this feeling was intensifying.

Li Bufan knew that it was already taking effect, and at this time, he needed to supplement energy.

Li Bufan quickly tore open the packaging and took the 3 energy bars one by one.

These energy bars were quite heavy, and Li Bufan originally thought that digesting them would be more troublesome.

However, he didn't expect that as soon as they entered his mouth, the energy bars mixed with the liquid secreted in his mouth, turning into a unique liquid, and then entered his abdomen.

This liquid was very thick and tasted really good, like ice cream. He also drank some cold boiled water from the table to moisten his throat.

Then, he quickly lay down on the bed, closed his eyes, and waited quietly, not thinking about anything else.

Perhaps it was the effect of the potion, but Li Bufan quickly fell asleep.

.....

Three hours later, Li Bufan woke up, feeling a clarity in his mind, and his perspective and way of thinking about things had changed somewhat.

He temporarily thought about the process of this transformation, which was that he was lying on the bed asleep.

However, he had a dream.

He dreamed that he was traveling in the depths of the universe, encountering space storms, seeing nebulae and dust, and even meeting various civilizations.

Some civilizations, like the Humans on Blue Star, were still trapped on their home planets.

Others had already emerged from their cradles, possessing interstellar fleets capable of traversing light-years.

But in the end, a giant hand seemed to have taken him in, and then his vision blurred, he could no longer see, and he seemed to have lost consciousness, becoming neither alive nor dead.

Suddenly, Li Bufan was startled and thought of a terrifying possibility.

So he quickly shook his head, looked at his reflection in the mirror, and then sighed, slowly muttering to himself.

"So that wasn't a dream, but a real history.

However, this is not my story, but the story of this 'Fengli' life form that died because of me.

Its life was long and splendid, yet in the end, it could not escape that giant hand.

What was that hand? Was it fate? Haha, thinking about these things is still too far away for me.

It's better to develop well on Blue Star first. When I reach the starry sky and the great sea, that will be the time to truly begin exploring the mysteries of the universe."

Li Bufan was very curious about that dream and asked the system.

"System, what was that dream about, and what was that incredibly large hand about?"

"System, I sense that you may have already realized the truth. Why are you unwilling to admit it?

The gap between different civilization levels is like a chasm, the difference between an elephant and an ant, or even more so.

As for the matter of that hand, it is best that you do not mention it again, otherwise you are very likely to be taken away by a high-level civilization as an experimental subject for slicing and research."

Li Bufan understood that this must be related to the existence of the system, something that even high-level civilizations would covet.

Thinking of this, Li Bufan quickly shook his head and stopped thinking about it.

Just kidding, he hadn't lived enough yet. How could he just be so aggrieved and become an experimental subject in the hands of Aliens? Isn't that a waste of talent?

So, Li Bufan stopped reminiscing about the dream and instead felt the changes in his brain.

First, he began to think about the English paper writing that had previously troubled him, and the results were overwhelming.

A few minutes later, Li Bufan had already constructed the framework and structure of the entire paper in his mind, and even cleverly set traps in the places where several key technologies were described.

This kind of scientific research trap is the most terrifying, because it will lead other researchers to obtain similar results in experiments, but they will lack generality.

That is to say, if following Li Bufan's experimental steps, near-perfect translation from Chinese to English can be achieved.

This will lead most people to believe that Li Bufan has made a huge contribution to the progress of Human scientific endeavors.

But after actual operation, they will find that there are still some imperfect places, and Li Bufan can completely explain this by saying that the amount of data used by the other party is too small.

Because, Li Bufan can completely state a number that is unimaginable to countless companies, such as 100PB of data.

And 1PB = 1024TB, 1TB = 1024GB, 1GB = 1024MB.

It is important to know that the experimental data in general papers is at most in the range of zero point zero something TB, but Li Bufan has completely raised the quantity by too many orders of magnitude.

As for the method of training large batches of data in the model, Li Bufan will keep it confidential, covering it up as company secret.

Furthermore, according to Li Bufan's trap, for translations between other languages, the accuracy rate will be greatly reduced, completely failing to achieve the perfect level of Chinese-English translation described in the experiment.

The experimental results are even only slightly better than the currently proposed models.

As Li Bufan continued to conceive, he suddenly realized a problem.

He found that he originally wanted to see if there was any good way to write in English now, but he didn't expect that not only was there no pressure, but he could also directly compose the text in his mind.

This couldn't help but surprise Li Bufan. It turned out that an IQ of 300 was so terrifying. No wonder those former top scorers on the college entrance examination felt no pressure in learning. At the same time, he sighed, it is indeed true that good goods in the system are not cheap, it was worth spending 5000 points, it was very cost-effective.

Subsequently, Li Bufan thought about some mathematical problems, and found that some problems became so simple.

This feeling of IQ crushing is very wonderful, a never-before-experienced sensation.

This gave Li Bufan the illusion that he could rival Einstein and Newton.

That's right, it's an illusion.

Because, although Li Bufan's IQ has been improved, even surpassing his predecessors, his knowledge reserve is still far from sufficient.

Even if many pieces of knowledge can be derived by himself, it still requires a large amount of time.

From this perspective, he is now far inferior to Newton, and even more so to Einstein.

However, perhaps in the future, he will be able to rival or even surpass them, which requires time to accumulate knowledge.

At this moment, Li Bufan deeply understood the meaning represented by the phrase, knowledge is power.

He had a feeling of wanting to immerse himself in the library, wanting to swim in the ocean of knowledge, absorbing nutrients, and thereby advancing the progress of Human technology.

Then, Li Bufan thought of a possibility.

If, in the future, everyone in his team injected the Brain Development Potion.

Then, would it mean that there would be existences in various fields comparable to Einstein?

At that time, wouldn't the advancement of technology be simple?

Thinking of this, Li Bufan somehow swallowed his saliva, seemingly yearning for the beautiful world of the future, yearning for countless banknotes to fly towards him.

However, Li Bufan also knew that this kind of thing must never be discovered by anyone, not even Liu Yuting and his brothers for the time being.

At least when he doesn't have the power to protect himself, it must never be exposed.

But perhaps his talent can be revealed simply, so let's start with the publication of the paper.
