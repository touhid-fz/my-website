Chapter 11 Zuckerberg to visit China



Yesterday afternoon, Li Bufan announced the list of new hires for the Technical Department. This morning, those people arrived one after another.

Currently, the company has nearly 35 employees in total.

Bu Changzhuo arranged the specific work for those employees, while Li Bufan gathered the people from the Technical Department for a meeting.

“Everyone, I will briefly assign today's work. This morning, everyone should first set up their own computers, help colleagues install the system, download the software, and perform debugging.

In the afternoon, I will provide training and tell you how my Smart Mutual Translation was developed. I will also explain the methods needed to improve it.

In other words, starting this afternoon, everyone can officially begin working.”

Everyone was very excited to hear Li Bufan say he would teach them how to develop Smart Mutual Translation.

After trying the software, they all expressed admiration for the developer of this software.

Now that they had the opportunity to start developing, smiles couldn't help but appear on their faces.

In the morning, the company's 10 programmers helped configure everyone's computers.

After seeing that all the employees were ready to start working, Li Bufan went to a place where no one was around and had alpha take control of these computers' permissions.

“alpha, implement the surveillance plan.”

“As you command, Master.”

In the afternoon, Li Bufan gathered the programmers, brought his own computer, and sat with them in the meeting room, projecting his computer screen onto the curtain using a projector.

Then, Li Bufan explained while operating.

“This software is the Smart Mutual Translation development tool that you will need to understand and master in the future. You can add new features or modify existing ones based on this.

However, some features are locked, such as paid features. I will transfer this software to your office computers, but I will make some modifications to it.

You will not be able to share or copy this software; it can only be used locally.”

“You can treat this development tool as an IDE for a programming language, although the language is relatively simple. The specific operation documentation is included in the software, which you can find.

I will briefly demonstrate feature modification. For example, to modify the font style, find the font-related code on the configuration page, then modify font-family, save it, and then you can export it.

It is worth noting that this software can export multiple applications or software, corresponding to different platforms.

For example, my computer is an Apple laptop, and I will install the .dmg format file that was just exported. Okay, the installation is successful, let's test the feature we just modified.

Hmm, the text style has indeed changed. Alright, having seen this, does anyone have any questions?”

“Hello, CTO. I would like to ask, didn't you say you would let us know how the Smart Mutual Translation was developed?

However, it seems this software is already packaged and is a black box operation.”

“Heh heh, this is one of the company's biggest secrets. This is the company's core confidential information and must not be leaked. If you really want to know, stay with our company for 3 years, during which I will evaluate you.

If you meet my requirements, allowing you access to company confidential information is not impossible. As long as you work hard for the company, there will be opportunities.”

“So that's how it is. I apologize, I was negligent. I should have known that such a good thing must be a secret that is not passed on.

However, I will work hard and contribute to the company.”

“Mm, not bad. Does anyone else have questions?”

Everyone shook their heads, indicating they had no more questions.

Seeing this, Li Bufan nodded and then announced the meeting adjourned. After the meeting, Li Bufan copied the software to these people's computers. Afterward, Li Bufan secretly took out his phone and instructed alpha.

“alpha, process the software I just copied. Modify it so that it can only be used locally, preventing them from copying or sharing the software in any way.”

“As you command, Master!”

......

Far away in California, Zuckerberg and the Facebook Board of Directors were holding a meeting.

Zuckerberg sat at the head, looking at the rest of the Board of Directors.

“Everyone, this is my sincerity. I am willing to sign this gambling agreement.

In this situation, please express your opinions on whether to cooperate with Smart Mutual Translation. Let's proceed with a vote.”

Zuckerberg was a little surprised to see that the Board of Directors members unanimously voted in favor. He was afraid this was a conspiracy specifically designed to trap his shares.

But after thinking carefully, he felt this was purely unnecessary.

Because if a member of the Board of Directors possessed this software, they would definitely point it out in the meeting, rather than trying to attract attention by privately emailing him.

Finally, the group of people on the Board of Directors passed this resolution. Zuckerberg was still happy. He knew better than anyone that with this heaven-defying feature, Facebook would quickly seize Twitter's market share and user base.

Finally, it was not impossible for the company to reach a market value of a trillion us dollars. Thinking of a trillion us dollars, Zuckerberg's face was filled with uncontrollable excitement.

Zuckerberg returned to his office and then instructed his secretary.

“Help me book a flight to Jiang City, China. The sooner, the better.”

The secretary seemed a little puzzled, not understanding why he suddenly wanted to go to China. So, she was a bit stunned, looking at Zuckerberg.

Seeing this, Zuckerberg explained, “I'm sure. Also, tell my two bodyguards that I will be visiting China.

Also, bring a few people from the company's legal department and a few from the Technical Department on this trip; a contract will need to be signed later. You should also go with me to help handle some miscellaneous matters. I'll leave the ticket booking to you.”

The secretary nodded and then left.

Half an hour later, the secretary knocked on the door. After Zuckerberg opened the door, the secretary handed him several plane tickets.

“Boss, I have already booked the tickets to Jiang City. I have contacted your bodyguards and the legal department members, and they said they can be ready in the shortest possible time.

There are still 4 hours until departure time, please get ready. The arrival time is 10 AM local time on July 5th.”

“Mm, I understand, you've worked hard. I'll go home to prepare, and then you can have someone drive me to the airport.”

After speaking, the secretary nodded and then left the office.

At this point, Zuckerberg suddenly realized a problem. It seemed he hadn't contacted the person in the email yet. If it was a prank, then he would have wasted his time.

So, Zuckerberg reopened his email, found the email Li Bufan had sent him before, and then dialed the number.

......

“Ding ding ding.”

Li Bufan found his phone ringing in his pocket. He opened it and saw it was an unknown number, showing it was calling from the United States.

Li Bufan was startled at first, then overjoyed. So, he took a deep breath and began to answer.

“Hello. May I ask if you are Mr. Li? I am Zuckerberg, and I would like to talk to you.”

“Mm, hello Zuckerberg. I am Li Bufan. Please speak, is it about cooperating with our company on the Smart Mutual Translation feature?”

“Mm, indeed. I have to say, you are too talented. This feature is amazing and will be of great use to our Facebook.”

“Heh heh, thank you for the compliment. I presume your company's Technical Department has attempted to crack this software of mine. I wonder if there has been any progress?”

Li Bufan knew they were attempting to crack it because the backdoor program he left notified alpha of the cracker's IP address, and then alpha notified Li Bufan.

Zuckerberg was a little awkward, thinking, “If we couldn't crack it, did you think I would spend money to cooperate with you? Heh heh.”

However, at this moment, Zuckerberg couldn't pretend not to know anything. He could only give a dry laugh and feign calmness.

“Haha, Mr. Li is joking. To be honest with you, we did attempt to crack it, but we have to admire you; we were never successful, heh heh.

I wonder what Mr. Li wants in order to reach an exclusive cooperation with us?”

Seeing this, Li Bufan suppressed his inner excitement and spoke slowly.

“I said 20 billion us dollars for a strategic cooperation agreement and exclusive usage rights for your company.”

“Mm, but as you know, our company is a listed company.

Using this much cash would severely affect the normal operation of our company. I wonder how about 10 billion us dollars?”

From Zuckerberg's words, Li Bufan could hear his strong desire to possess the Smart Mutual Translation.

So, Li Bufan said unhurriedly, “Well, 20 billion us dollars is the final price. As for cash, if the company doesn't have it, can't it borrow? I presume there are dozens, if not hundreds, of banks willing to lend to your company, right?

Also, think about it, by getting on our fast track, perhaps by then, Twitter's users and the market in China will also be partially taken by you.

By then, how much your market value will rise, I don't need to tell you, right? In this situation, think about it, would the Board of Directors disagree?”

Seeing how cunning Li Bufan was, Zuckerberg felt helpless and could only say.

“Alright, Mr. Li, you win. I will sign the contract and transfer the 20 billion us dollars after arriving in Jiang City tomorrow.

However, as you also know, we are a listed company.

Such a large outflow of funds needs to be disclosed publicly. We hope you can cooperate with us and hold a press conference. This is beneficial for both you and us, isn't it?”

“Haha, my dear Mr. Zuckerberg, you are indeed generous.

Since that's the case, I will send someone to pick you up at the airport tomorrow. Regarding the press conference, when do you plan to hold it?”

“We plan to meet with you tomorrow first, and then have a few people from the Technical Department verify this technology to see if it can be integrated into our Facebook.

If there are no issues, I can have the legal department personnel draft the contract, which will likely take several hours.

Furthermore, holding a press conference requires inviting some media, which means we will hold the press conference the day after tomorrow and sign the cooperation agreement on the spot.

Afterward, I will have the head office transfer the 20 billion us dollars to your company as soon as possible.

Mr. Li, what do you think of my arrangement?”

“Hahaha, of course, that's no problem. I will personally host you tomorrow.”

“Mm. By the way, you mentioned the China market before. I wonder if it is possible for our Facebook to join the action of dividing up this massive market?”

Li Bufan sneered inwardly, it's good enough for you to capture the foreign market, and you still want to capture the China market. However, he didn't show it, only saying an ambiguous sentence.

“Mr. Zuckerberg, you should know. In our country, it is a society ruled by law, and everything needs to be handled according to the law.

If your party can accept the rectification opinions put forward by our government and transfer the servers to China for supervision, I presume the country would be very happy to see healthy competition.”

Zuckerberg smiled bitterly in his heart. Even if others didn't say it, didn't he know? If he did that, the first ones who wouldn't let him off would be the government departments in their country. After all, this data involves national security and defense.

“Alright, perhaps. Regardless, we are at least allies in the international market, right?”

“Haha, that's right, we are indeed allies. Then I'll see you tomorrow.”

At this moment, Li Bufan put down the phone and burst into laughter, feeling very happy. He thought to himself, “Poor Zuckerberg, he probably doesn't know that although this move of his will bring a short-term surge in market value, in the long run, heh heh, the market will eventually be occupied by me.

Haha, it's really hilarious. Let's see how I occupy your users then. China version of Facebook, let's wait and see.”

At this moment, Zuckerberg put down the phone and couldn't help but smile bitterly. To be honest, after hearing Li Bufan's firm and strong tone, he didn't know if this cooperation was right or wrong. But since he had already decided, he would just stick with it.
