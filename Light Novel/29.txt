Chapter 29 Early Autumn August



A few days passed like this. Everything at the company was peaceful, except for the increasing number of spies and intelligence personnel sent by external dispatch companies. Other than that, everything was fine.

Li Bufan also seemed quite satisfied with this kind of life. When he was bored, he would spend time with Liu Yuting, handling various matters for Huanyu Film and Television with her, especially preparing for casting and filming.

And August, a month destined to be extraordinary, arrived quietly.

It was another bright and sunny morning. Li Bufan sat in the Chairman's office, dealing with the documents in front of him.

A notification sound pulled Li Bufan away from his work.

"Ding. August 1st, a new month has arrived. As the system, you need to work harder."

"Newbie Task (Two). You must choose one and only one task from the following three. The task list is as follows:

1. 【Run 100 kilometers within three hours】.

Additional task requirement: You can rest midway, but you cannot use any transportation.

Task success reward: 3000 points.

Task failure penalty: Unable to use this system for one week.

Task difficulty: Medium-low.

2. 【Publish a paper within two weeks】.

Additional task requirement: Submit as the first author to Science or Nature. For every additional paper completed within two weeks, you can get an additional 50% reward.

Task completion reward: 1000 points.

Task failure penalty: Deduct half of the current points.

Task difficulty: Low.

3. 【Reach the Moon within one month】.

Additional task requirement: Need to personally arrive on the Moon and leave footprints on the Moon's surface.

Task completion reward: 40000 points.

Task failure penalty: Deduct all points.

Task difficulty: High.

The final interpretation right of the task belongs to this system."

The sudden system notification made Li Bufan a little frantic.

Because ever since he got the system, except for a little time at the beginning, he basically hadn't used it much afterwards.

When he usually needed help, he relied on the artificial intelligence alpha.

Li Bufan had almost forgotten the existence of the system, forgetting that there were system tasks.

Helplessly, Li Bufan looked at the system task panel in his mind again. There were three vastly different tasks listed on it.

The first task seemed to have appeared at the beginning, but at that time, Li Bufan's first thought was, how could this be completed.

But now, Li Bufan seemed to know how to complete it, which was to inject gene agents and wear high-tech running shoes. He thought that would be enough to complete this task.

But let alone high-tech running shoes, just the gene enhancement agent plus high-tech sports running shoes would cost more than 3000 points, which was not particularly cost-effective.

As for the last one, the reward was a full 40000 points. It seemed like a lot, but in reality, it was not.

Because Li Bufan opened the system mall and checked, he found that a small anti-gravity private spacecraft that could fly from Blue Star to the Moon would cost at least 50,000 points to start.

Not to mention the life support facilities needed to ensure simple survival in space and on the Moon.

Furthermore, once in the sky, it might be photographed by satellites from various countries, or even be treated as an unidentified flying object and shot down by Missiles.

Li Bufan dared not do such a dangerous thing.

Then Li Bufan looked at the second one, publishing a paper.

Then, he thought to himself, could he write a document analyzing the internal structure of Smart Mutual Translation as its inventor?

These days, the company had actually received many emails, all inquiring about the artificial intelligence architecture of Smart Mutual Translation, wanting to seek cooperation, but they had not given a direct response.

At the same time, there was also international public opinion, asking Zhi Gao Software to prioritize the technology of the entire Blue Star, holding high the banner of contributing to the progress of Human technology, and demanding that Zhi Gao Software share its core technology.

And Li Bufan also planned to use this as an opportunity, on the one hand, to ease the international outcry against Zhi Gao Software, and on the other hand, to guide their artificial intelligence development direction to a wrong place, slowing down the birth of artificial intelligence.

But the reward was only 1000 points, completely incomparable to the first task reward of 100,000 points, which made Li Bufan quite sad.

However, seeing that the 10-minute selection deadline was approaching and he needed to make a choice, otherwise it would be a random selection like the first time.

At this time, Li Bufan quickly made a choice.

"System, I choose the second task."

"Okay, system. You have chosen Task Two, 【Publish a paper within two weeks】.

The countdown begins. Please hurry up, system. The more papers published, the higher the points."

Li Bufan nodded secretly and began to think about how to write this AI paper.

Then he looked through some journals of Science and Nature and found that the dates of the next magazine publications were 3 days later and 34 days later.

In other words, if he wanted to publish within this month, Li Bufan needed to complete the first paper within these two days and successfully submit it.

However, after submission, whether the reviewers would accept it and whether the Editor-in-chief would arrange it in advance were all questions.

Therefore, Li Bufan planned to set the target for 34 days later, which meant completing it within these two weeks would be sufficient.

But Li Bufan was not sure if publishing in the journal 34 days later would count as a successful publication.

"System, I will submit the paper in a week, and the results will only be published in the journal 34 days later.

In that case, does it count as successfully completing the task?"

"System. For paper publication, you have two weeks to submit the paper.

Afterwards, if your paper is accepted, it will be counted towards the task progress. The specific issue it is published in is decided by the Editor-in-chief. It might be very soon, or it might take several months.

The system will wait until all papers have been judged by the reviewers and Editor-in-chief before calculating them into the task completion progress.

So, please don't worry, system, just showcase your talent."

So, Li Bufan began to learn some relevant terms in the field of artificial intelligence and looked at some papers related to artificial intelligence published in Science.

.......

Far away in a place hundreds of kilometers away, it was the location where Huanyu Film and Television was recruiting actors.

For this recruitment, Liu Yuting accepted Li Bufan's suggestion. After receiving the resumes, she conducted a screening and then kept actors with good character.

Among them, many celebrities were eliminated, mainly because alpha used backend data from various internet companies and invaded global surveillance equipment to find records of their undesirable behavior such as drug use.

Therefore, these people were ruthlessly eliminated.

At first, these celebrities, relying on their status of having millions or even more fans, negotiated with the staff of Huanyu Film and Television, wanting to use backdoors.

However, after being secretly called into a room without surveillance, they would see a shelf with the black history and undesirable behavior of those celebrities.

After seeing this, those celebrities turned pale one by one and no longer mentioned competing for roles.

Instead, they started flattering the staff, asking them to make sure these things were not exposed.

The notice the staff received was that if they were sensible and didn't cause trouble again, then it would be fine, and the past events would not spread online.

Conversely, they would be responsible for the consequences and should take care of themselves.

Today is the actor recruitment day for "Blue Star Defense War".

At the scene, there were over 200 extras, hundreds of internet celebrities, and dozens of A-list stars.

These people were competing for different positions. Most of the extras wanted a relatively good supporting role, the internet celebrities wanted supporting roles, and the stars wanted to be the protagonists.

However, this recruitment meeting adopted a live broadcast format to be public, fair, and transparent.

And on the official website of Huanyu Film and Television, which was broadcasting live, hundreds of thousands of viewers had already flooded in.

"Wow, who do I see? Isn't that Sister Fei Fei? And Director Zhou?"

"Haha, yes. I didn't expect there to be so many big stars. I'm in for a treat this time."

"Why hasn't it started yet? I've already projected the screen onto the TV. I've prepared my little stool and peanuts, just waiting for the casting."

"Soon, there are 17 minutes left, just wait."

After a while, the live broadcast camera switched to a stage. Standing on it was a breathtaking beauty, Liu Yuting.

"Online audience friends, I am Liu Yuting, CEO of Huanyu Film and Television. This is the character selection site for Huanyu Film and Television's 'Blue Star Defense War'.

Next, I will take everyone to see the roles the participating actors want to play and their performances."

"Next, I will randomly interview some people to see what role they chose in the film."

Liu Yuting walked up to a super good-looking young lady who was closest to her.

"Hello, excuse me.

I am the CEO of Huanyu Film and Television, and I am currently live-streaming this casting process.

I would like to ask who you are, what role you want to choose this time, what preparations you have made for it, and do you feel confident?"

"Ah, hello. I am Zhang Liang, 23 years old.

After Huanyu Film and Television announced the casting plan for 'Blue Star Defense War', I carefully studied the entire novel. It is a novel full of heartache and tears.

The role I want to play is the Captain's girlfriend, the female lead. I believe I have a chance to achieve this.

Because, in the novel, the protagonist joins the Space Force and goes to the Moon Base to resist the arrival of the Alien fleet.

The protagonist and his girlfriend are separated, and only occasionally have brief moments to communicate.

And as the girlfriend's responsibility, at this time, I will bring him hope, bring him warmth, and let him have the belief that he will surely win against the Alien fleet.

But normally, this girlfriend will become uneasy because she cannot see him for long periods and hears about the approaching Alien fleet on the news, spending her days in tears.

However, on the days she can communicate with him, the girlfriend will pretend as if nothing is wrong, becoming very sunny and cheerful, bringing light.

And I have the ability to change my face quickly.

For example, smiling, hehe. For example, getting angry, 

snort

. For example, sad, 

Woohoo

. For example, excited, haha."

The netizens were very surprised to see this young lady analyze the female lead's psychological activities clearly and make rapid changes.

"This young lady is so beautiful."

"That's right, the performance is so vivid, it's decided it's you."

"Yes, choose her!"

"+1"

Meanwhile, Liu Yuting, who was standing nearby, was stunned by her performance, a little disbelieving that she could be so changeable.

The key was that when she was acting sad, she actually shed tears, which made Liu Yuting almost think she had thought of something sad and was about to comfort her.

Unexpectedly, the next second she burst into excited laughter, making Liu Yuting wipe away cold sweat. That was close, she almost embarrassed herself.

"Miss Zhang Liang, your performance is indeed very good.

However, the specifics are not up to me, but up to the judges on site.

When the time comes, you must perform well. I have high hopes for you."

Zhang Liang was very excited upon hearing this and nodded repeatedly.

"Thank you, thank you, CEO, for your affirmation. I am very happy and I will work hard."

Then, Liu Yuting walked up to a gentleman who seemed to be deep in thought beside her.

Online, netizens saw his profile and recognized who he was at a glance. They didn't expect such a coincidence.

"Wow, isn't that my male idol? He's here too, that's great."

"Haha, isn't this the male lead of 'wandering blue star'? Why is he here too? There will be a good show to watch later."

"Needless to say, I think the male lead this time must be him."

At this moment, he raised his head, looked at Liu Yuting, frowned slightly, looked very puzzled, and then with a serious expression, began to ask.

"Excuse me, is something wrong?"

"Hello, excuse me.

I am Liu Yuting, CEO of Huanyu Film and Television. I am currently doing a simple random interview. I just saw you were deep in thought. May I ask what you were thinking about?"

"Oh, I was thinking about acting."

"Oh, oh, may I ask if you could introduce yourself briefly.

Also, what role do you want to play, and what preparations have you made for it?"

"Hmm, okay, I'll just say a little.

I am Wu Jin, the male lead of 'wandering blue star', and the male lead of 'China God of War' 1 to 3. That's about it for my self-introduction.

I am also competing for the male lead this time. I think my temperament is very suitable for this role.

First of all, what attracts me to this role is the male lead's determination to serve China and protect Blue Star, as well as his spirit of moving forward fearlessly and not fearing sacrifice. Also, I am very satisfied with his identity as a Captain.

As for preparation, I am always ready."

Liu Yuting really didn't expect to meet such a big star. While delighted, she could also understand his aloof attitude.

After all, as an actor, the primary task is to perform with genuine emotion according to the script, not to accept interviews.

At this time, it was almost time for the formal character selection.

Liu Yuting walked back to the front of the stage.

"Friends, the casting segment is about to begin. Actors, please come up to the stage after your number is called.

Afterwards, the five judges below the stage will communicate with you.

And now, I will hand over the time to everyone. The hosting duties will be taken over by our judges.

Alright, the camera doesn't need to be on me anymore. Switch to the judges and the stage."

"Number one, please come to the stage. Number one, please come to the stage."

"Number one, hello, please give a brief self-introduction."

"Oh, okay. Good morning, judges. I am Song Biluo, 24 years old this year, and I am currently a short video blogger with 2 million followers."

"Song Biluo, right? Okay, tell us what role you want to play and why you think you can do it."

"Okay, I want to play the employee of the radio receiving station who attracted the Alien fleet.

Because this villain role, I think it's a little bit evil and very interesting.

I want to try it. I think I have talent in this area."

"Oh? Perform a segment.

Perform the process from receiving the signal to replying. Let's see."

"Hmm, okay."

"Huh, Station Master, what is this signal?"

"Could it be a broadcast signal from Aliens? The signal direction is from the direction of the M32 Nebula."

"Should we change the sending signal to send towards the M32 Nebula? This way, maybe we can communicate with the Aliens."

"Oh dear, what if the Aliens use this to scan whether there are low-level civilizations, and then invade?"

"Blue Star is already overburdened now. Attracting Alien civilization, it shouldn't be worse than destroying Blue Star, right? Why not give it a try."

"Just right, there's no one here now. Adjust the frequency to 137.376 terahertz, point the satellite at the M32 Nebula, set the content to the binary code for 'Hello', and add the code dictionary. That should do it.

Should I reply to the signal now? Forget it, reply first. Okay, that's it. 3. 2. 1. Press."

"Whew... Judges, I'm done performing. I wonder if I can play this role?"

"This needs to wait until everyone has been on stage once to be determined. Please go rest in the back. You will be notified of the results later."

"Oh, okay, okay, thank you, judges."

Meanwhile, the audience friends watching the live stream had sharp eyes.

"This one can't compare to the previous young lady. The performance is too artificial, not like it at all."

"Hmm, yes, the inner thoughts and expressions are very unconvincing."

"After all, she was the first one on stage. Being able to do this is already very good."

"Let's see. If there's no one better, it might have to be this one. It's barely acceptable, still watchable."

"That's right, I hope there's someone better."

...

The casting segment ended. Unexpectedly, the male and female leads were exactly the two people Liu Yuting interviewed.

This led to many discussions online that Liu Yuting was simply amazing, incredibly lucky, able to meet the protagonists just by chance, so fortunate.

The results were also announced on the spot and subsequently posted on the official website.

However, after the results were announced, no one questioned them. Everyone felt that this fair and just casting method was very interesting and worth watching.

...

And at this time, Li Bufan was still reading papers, studying writing techniques and experience, and starting to try writing in English.
