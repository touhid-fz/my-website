Chapter 23 Agreements are meant to be broken



Back home, Li Bufan and Liu Yuting shared a tender moment, opening up to each other.

"Li Bufan, are you monitoring me?"

"Hmm? Why would you say that?"

"Because, I can feel it."

For example, when I walk into a place that was originally a blind spot for surveillance, the cameras in that area turn with my steps.

At first, I thought it was normal, but later I saw that the cameras didn't change when other people walked around.

But I was the exception.

Also, when I browse some websites or download certain software, the browser warns me that there is a virus or the page is dangerous.

And I know very well that before I was with you, I had never seen such a prompt.

So, all of this is manipulated by you behind the scenes, am I right?"

"Yes, you are.

I am indeed monitoring you.

Not just you, but also the company's senior management, and even ordinary employees.

However, the focus of the monitoring is different.

For important personnel, such as you and the company's senior management, I will use a protective method for monitoring.

For example, you will be reminded about certain websites with viruses.

As for ordinary employees, they are quietly watched, and action is only taken in case of extremely urgent danger, such as kidnapping or other life-threatening situations.

Besides that, the monitoring of ordinary employees is generally to check for espionage or being bribed, etc."

Li Bufan answered Liu Yuting's question without hesitation, telling her the truth.

After all, she was his girlfriend, and he should be more sincere; if he was wary of everyone, wouldn't he be too lonely?

Of course, Li Bufan didn't tell Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong, not because he didn't trust them, but because he didn't want to cause them unnecessary trouble.

Liu Yuting was stunned when she heard Li Bufan's confirmation.

She had thought Li Bufan would flatly deny it, but she didn't expect him to be so honest.

This left her speechless; on one hand, she was a little angry about being monitored, but on the other hand, she was a little happy about the so-called protective monitoring, and she was also very satisfied with Li Bufan's honesty.

Finally, Liu Yuting seemed to have made up her mind.

"Li Bufan, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ask that question.

Although I was a little unhappy at first, I know you're doing this for my own good.

I am yours in life and your ghost in death; I will never fall in love with anyone else in this lifetime.

So please rest assured, this matter is known only to heaven, earth, you, and me, and I will keep it buried deep inside."

Li Bufan was afraid that Liu Yuting would be repulsed, but he still considered being honest, and unexpectedly, it made Liu Yuting decide to follow him wholeheartedly, which made him very happy.

"Haha, that's good, don't worry, I will never leave you either.

Oh, I have a surprise for you."

Liu Yuting's eyes widened, seemingly filled with little stars, as she looked at Li Bufan, apparently looking forward to the surprise he mentioned.

"What's the surprise? Can you tell me?"

Seeing her impatient and adorable look, Li Bufan smiled knowingly, nodded, thought for a moment, and then slowly spoke.

"I'm going to promote you, not just a regular promotion.

But the position of the company's top leader."

"Ah, what does that mean? I don't quite understand.

Making me the CEO, isn't that Brother Bu Changzhuo's position? Wouldn't it be bad to push him out?"

"Ahem... The company I'm talking about is not Zhi Gao Software Company.

It's a brand new company, engaged in a brand new industry, and I plan to give you half of the company's shares.

I plan to invest 5 billion yuan as the startup capital for this company."

"Oh, I see, what kind of company is it? What industry? Have you thought of a company name?"

"Actually, this company's idea was initially inspired by what you said to me.

That's right, it's a film and television company.

This film and television company will invest in high-quality and potential films, and also shoot some movies and TV series.

And for the movies we shoot ourselves, I think we can use two methods.

One is the traditional production method, and the other is a brand new virtual idol production method.

The former will recruit well-known actors for shooting, while the latter will be completely modeled, special effects processed, and rendered on a computer."

"Especially regarding the latter, due to our unique advantages in software at Zhi Gao Software, the future film and television company can completely establish a strategic partnership with Zhi Gao Software.

One is responsible for providing ideas, concepts, plot, and direction, while the other is responsible for model generation, special effects production, and rendering, etc.

Finally, the two sides will cooperate to complete the virtualization shooting of this movie."

"I saw that you had a very thorough understanding of the film industry before.

Therefore, I would like to invite Madam Liu Yuting to serve as the CEO and Chairman of this new company.

Would you do me the honor?"

"Mhm mhm, of course I'm willing.

Hehe, thank you, Li Bufan, you are so good to me, I love you."

"Hehe, that's a must."

"Oh, what should the company be named? Any ideas?"

"I heard there's a film company called Universal Pictures, so since we're going to do it, we have to be more advanced than them, so let's call it Huanyu Film and Television, how about that?"

"Wow, that's a great name.

It's perfect since we'll be focusing on sci-fi films in the future; this name is very fitting for our film company."

"Hehe.

Tingting, as long as you're satisfied.

As for some cooperation methods and related software, etc., I will help you organize them.

But, as for the matter of establishing the company, I'll leave it to you, how about that?

Oh, and later, you can go ahead and resign from your previous position in market operations.

Then, I'll set up a position for you as Chairman's Assistant, just part-time.

This way, you can come to my office and see me anytime."

"Mhm, okay, I can handle it myself.

It's good to resign, so I can focus on our shared career.

Uh, Chairman's Assistant? Why does it sound a bit like a secretary? It wouldn't be that kind of position where there's something... nothing..."

"Ahem... Tingting, don't worry about those details."

......

The next day, with Li Bufan's help, Liu Yuting resigned from her original position, officially became Chairman's Assistant, and went to the Administration for Industry and Commerce to register Huanyu Film and Television Company.

Some colleagues in the marketing department were both envious and jealous when they found out, and their eyes towards Liu Yuting changed.

They no longer looked at her with the condescending attitude of a senior, but with an almost fawning and ingratiating attitude.

This made Liu Yuting a little slow to react at first, but then she thought about how she would not only be Chairman's Assistant but also the CEO and Chairman of another company, and suddenly felt that all of this was only natural, and she calmly accepted her colleagues' flattery.

The idea of virtualization shooting came to Li Bufan after seeing the 30-second special effects video produced by alpha and pondering it deeply.

And Li Bufan had an unwritten idea, which was to have alpha join in as a "technical consultant."

First, alpha and the quantum computer it occupies will join the production of film and television dramas in the form of software.

We all know that after a script is completed, a series of considerations need to be made regarding the characters, costumes, scenes, actions, special effects, etc.

And for those special effects production companies, whenever a new movie script is placed in front of them, they need to carefully study the details within, begin to deliberate, then think and come up with a mental model image.

And this process can be said to be a tedious and boring process, but it is indeed necessary, and it occupies the largest proportion of time in post-production.

Li Bufan believes that this kind of mechanical and repetitive work should not be handled by Humans, but should be completely completed by artificial intelligence.

And Li Bufan has such a divine tool in his hands, alpha and its body - the quantum computer.

Therefore, Li Bufan plans to have alpha develop software that will change the current situation.

First, the input of the software is the script, as well as specific descriptions and constraints for certain physical models within it.

The output of the software is complete models that can be used in the Aurora Special Effects production software.

And the software's calculation process will be a black box operation, making people only think that advanced artificial intelligence algorithms are being used, and not think that behind it, a truly advanced artificial intelligence is involved.

At the same time, to prevent some people from abusing, wasting computing resources, or doing private work for other companies.

Each use must be reported beforehand, and the software can only be used after obtaining permission from the upper management.

Li Bufan believes that with this kind of software, the company's production department will burst out with unparalleled enthusiasm and generate huge profits.

Of course, the profit from special effects is not large; the main profit comes from box office revenue sharing, which is the Huanyu Film and Television that Li Bufan gave half of the shares to Liu Yuting.

As for the next issue, which is the most core issue, the source of movies, scripts, or some novels.

To this end, Li Bufan's idea is for the company to acquire those online literature companies at a premium, then reorganize the websites, so that more and more writers choose to sign copyright transfer agreements with the company.

And the company will not treat them unfairly.

The company promises that if a movie is released, they can receive one percent of the box office as commission.

Don't look at just one percent; you should know that "wandering blue star" received a box office of 4.6 billion yuan, which means the writer can get a commission of 46 million yuan.

Presumably, this astronomical figure is very desirable for many writers.

Next, Li Bufan summoned Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong and began discussing the acquisition of online literature companies on the internet.

When everyone learned that Li Bufan had given half of the shares of the new company to Liu Yuting, they couldn't help but feel a little envious.

Although they were senior executives of Zhi Gao Software, they only had one percent of the dividends, which was completely incomparable to Liu Yuting.

Seeing their hesitant expressions, Li Bufan knew that they seemed dissatisfied with his decision, but Li Bufan's next sentence dispelled their dissatisfaction.

"I plan to be with her."

They immediately understood, so that's how it was.

Doesn't that mean that Liu Yuting will be Brother's wife from now on, and part of Li Bufan's family?

It's not excessive to give any amount of money to family.

Thinking of this, they suddenly realized, but then they thought that they at least had one percent of the dividends, while other senior executives still seemed to have no dividends at all, so they began to feel a mix of gains and losses, and their minds became balanced.

"So that's how it is.

Brother, congratulations."

"Wow, I admire you, I admire you.

When are you treating us to wedding wine?"

Wang Huadong and Bu Changzhuo replied one by one.

Li Bufan smiled.

"Hehe, marriage is still a long way off, after all, I'm still very young, and I still have a career to be busy with."

Li Bufan then became serious and said in a deep voice.

"Let's discuss, which online literature company is best to acquire?"

"The largest online literature company is Tian Tian Reading, under Tencent Group.

It has the most authors and readers, and its works number in the millions.

However, their group is large and powerful, and they won't agree to us acquiring their subsidiary.

I think we might as well acquire some niche online literature platforms; although the number of people cannot be compared with Tian Tian Reading, we can still integrate them, how about that?"

"I don't think so.

If we're going to acquire, we should acquire the best.

Are we going to acquire a small company, then re-promote, and then integrate?

Furthermore, you should know that people have almost formed a fixed mindset now; ninety percent of legitimate readers read on Tian Tian Reading.

As for the pirated ones, let's not talk about them, because our company disdains doing pirated work.

After acquiring Tian Tian Reading later, we will also severely crack down on piracy."

Li Bufan heard their ideas and thought they both made sense, but the problem lay with Tencent Group; he didn't know if they would be willing to reluctantly part with it and agree to Zhi Gao Software acquiring Tian Tian Reading.

"Then what do you think, if we want to acquire Tian Tian Reading, is there any way?"

At this time, Bu Changzhuo was the first to answer.

"It's not that there's no way, and there's an existing opportunity right now.

Brother, you know that since our Smart Mutual Translation reached a strategic partnership with Facebook, Facebook has already launched the smart translation function during this time.

Now, Facebook is swallowing up the international social market share, and Facebook's valuation has increased by over a hundred billion US dollars during this time, and its stock price has risen by 20%!

And some time ago, Ma Dage from Tencent Group also sent someone over, wanting to discuss cooperation in the area of Smart Mutual Translation.

However, because we signed an exclusive agreement with Facebook, we cannot cooperate with their product - Micro-Speech.

I think if we can make Micro-Speech also have this function, they will definitely be willing for us to acquire Tian Tian Reading.

However, doing so would actually break the agreement with Zuckerberg.

But, an agreement is something that is meant to be broken.

Furthermore, I believe that as long as we do it well on the surface and don't let them catch us, that's enough.

We can completely use some shell companies registered in the Cayman Islands to help us with some capital operations."

Li Bufan was very surprised by Bu Changzhuo's words, not expecting him to have a talent for politics.

While being secretly vigilant, he also developed a little interest and wanted to hear him finish his words.

"Since it's a secret oral agreement, we won't sign any contract documents.

But how to ensure the normal operation of the agreement?

On this point, I think Brother, you and Ma Dage had best communicate in person to achieve this.

Actually, he will most likely agree, because for Ma Dage, the current core business is Micro-Speech.

We are actually willing to share the interface for smart translation, which is actually a great advantage for them.

If it weren't for the exclusive agreement, we could completely get Tian Tian Reading for free.

Therefore, our cooperation can only be carried out secretly, only promised orally, and not written down.

At the same time, we must follow normal procedures for the acquisition, so a premium is also an indispensable part.

As for the company located in the Cayman Islands, we can completely agree privately to give them a handling fee and then complete a series of transfer operations.

As a shell company, I think a fee of 100 million is already enough for them to bear all the risks.

I think Tencent will be very happy to pay a considerable fee to cooperate with that company.

In short, we can complete the acquisition plan for Tian Tian Reading."

Clap clap clap...

Li Bufan felt that Bu Changzhuo's words were logical and very reasonable, and began to applaud.

"Very good.

How to implement the specific plan.

The shell company and the acquisition negotiation team will be left to you to handle.

As for the BOSS of the opposing Tencent Group, I will give him enough face and personally fly to their company headquarters to have a good talk with him."

"Okay, the acquisition matter and the company in the Cayman Islands, just leave it all to me."

At this time, Bu Changzhuo patted his chest, agreeing with excitement.

Just like that, a plan targeting the acquisition of Tian Tian Reading quietly unfolded.
