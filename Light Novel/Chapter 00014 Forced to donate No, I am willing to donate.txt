Chapter 0001:4: Forced to donate? No, I am willing to donate



Less than an hour after over 100 billion rmb arrived, Li Bufan's phone rang.

"Ring, ring...."

Li Bufan picked up the phone.

"Hello, this is China Merchants Bank. May I ask if a fund of over 120 billion yuan has just arrived in your company account?"

Li Bufan slightly furrowed his brows, feeling very dissatisfied with the bank's behavior of monitoring customer fund movements.

"So what if it is? How can you monitor our funds?"

"I'm sorry, Mr., this is a bank regulation.

This is also to prevent transaction errors and allow for timely account freezing, etc.

In short, we do this entirely for the benefit of our customers."

"Alright, I don't care why you monitor fund movements.

If you just want to verify, then you can hang up."

"Wait, don't hang up. Since it's confirmed to be a normal transaction, I'd like to ask, how do you plan to use this money?"

"What? How I want to use the money, does that have anything to do with you?

Just because I have a lot of money, you want me to leave it in the bank to gather dust?"

"No, Mr.. We can provide you with various financial services here, with much higher interest rates than current deposits.

If you want to do charity, we also have connections with the Red Cross. You can entrust it to us, and we guarantee not to embezzle a single cent of your money.

Oh, and since your account balance is quite large, we have already granted you Super VIP status, which exempts you from interbank transaction fees within China."

Li Bufan sneered in his heart. Who knows how good your financial services are.

To put it nicely, it's financial services; to put it bluntly, it's various funds, and there are plenty of examples of losses.

Also, you keep saying that charity won't embezzle donations, so why are you so proactive? If there wasn't an interest chain in between, I wouldn't believe it. It's more reassuring to donate yourself.

As for Super VIP, although it exempts you from interbank transfer fees within China, the maximum fee is only a few hundred thousand, which is just a drop in the bucket compared to these over 100 billion.

Heh heh, you're really shrewd. As long as I deposit the money in your bank, you can bring in endless benefits.

"No need, I have other uses for this money. I advise you to be more rule-abiding.

Don't take matters into your own hands or misappropriate my funds, otherwise I don't mind letting your bank go bankrupt."

"Uh, okay, Mr.. I've disturbed you, goodbye."

"Click...."

Li Bufan hung up the phone and couldn't help but shake his head.

"It seems when you have money, even the bank treats you like a revered master, heh heh.

However, with such a large sum of money, and also because the company is a university student startup and doesn't need to pay taxes in the first year, having such a large sum of money in hand makes me uneasy.

Even if the people above don't trouble us, others will morally blackmail our company.

Hmm, I'll go check Weibo to see the pictures from our company's previous press conference and see how the general public is evaluating it."

"alpha, open the relevant comment page for our company's Weibo."

Li Bufan was too lazy to click through the pages one by one, so he directly ordered alpha to quickly open the relevant page.

"Oh my god, what kind of company is this? Can you understand why a translation function can sell for 20 billion us dollar?"

"The person above must be short-sighted. Honestly, 20 billion us dollar is neither too much nor too little; it's a very upper-middle-level price, after all, its value is right here.

For Facebook, this much money is just a drop in the bucket. At most, it will cause some short-term strain, but very quickly, they can fully recover from the stock market."

"The person above is right, this company really brings glory to our China people. It's the first time I've seen a China company demand such a high price and succeed. It's amazing."

"Haha, yes, this company extorted so much money, Jiang City must be very happy, after all, there will be a lot of tax revenue."

"I am a Jiang City person. I just consulted the relevant departments and found out they don't need to pay taxes."

"How can making money not require paying taxes? This is not a state-owned enterprise, and state-owned enterprises not only have to pay taxes but also seem to have to pay a certain percentage of their profits."

"The person above is probably uninformed. Not needing to pay taxes is because the local regulations stipulate that university student startups enjoy a tax exemption policy for the first year."

"This is too unfair, isn't it? After all, this company made so much money, not just one or two million, but hundreds of billions.

I believe this company must fulfill its social responsibility and take care of over a billion compatriots."

"That's right, we don't need much, giving us one hundred per person is enough."

"No need to donate to me, just donate to the children in the mountains who can't afford food or go to school. They are the flowers of China, and they need to be nurtured with care."

"Agree + 1."

"Agree + 2."

.......

Li Bufan was speechless when he saw these comments.

He thought, why should he donate just because they saw him make money?

Sigh, what kind of world is this?

However, Li Bufan didn't know who to donate to, because after the Red Cross scandal broke out, he didn't really trust these so-called charitable organizations.

Just at this moment, Li Bufan suddenly thought of the omnipotent system.

"system, you said before that when I spend money to top up points, it's equivalent to donating.

However, it goes through many steps in between, and others cannot trace it, is that right?"

"system, that is correct."

"system, can you help me out? I want others to know that I am donating, which means you should operate a little less.

Or, if I designate some charitable organizations and donate to them, would that count as topping up points?"

"system, I can help you with that operation. However, for those charitable organizations, the system has unique rules for judging losses.

For example, if you donate to the China Poor Mountain Village Children's Charitable Foundation, then you can get 97% of the top-up points."

"So, donating equals spending money? Spending money equals topping up system store points?"

"That's right, system."

Li Bufan thought about it and felt that this method was indeed good. On one hand, donating can alleviate the pressure from public opinion.

On the other hand, he wasn't donating for nothing; he was also getting incredibly valuable system store points.

So, Li Bufan called Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong and showed them the company's Weibo comment section.

Bu Changzhuo looked at these people's words, feeling a bit angry, but also helpless and somewhat frustrated.

"Brother, is there nothing we can do about these people? Are we just going to let them slander our company's reputation?"

"Yes, Brother, we can't be too passive. We need to actively counterattack."

Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong both felt very unfair about this and strongly disliked these people's moral blackmail. It was as if making money and not donating was wrong.

Li Bufan shook his head.

"Of course, we can't just let this go. Afterwards, I will find those who slandered our company indiscriminately, add them to our company's blacklist, and prevent them from enjoying our company's services in the future.

After all, although our company's current product is only software, and the service is just a translation function, in the future, the starry sky and the great sea, life extension, nothing is impossible as long as we dare to think and dare to do! By then, those people will understand what the consequences of opposing us will be!"

However, some of what they said is also right. Although we enjoy the tax exemption policy, it doesn't mean that we don't need to do charity.

I thought about it and finally decided to make a donation.

I plan to donate 10 billion us dollar in one go, which will save them from gossiping."

At this moment, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong looked at Li Bufan with disbelief, not understanding why he would donate so much.

Actually, to be honest, if Li Bufan hadn't discovered that donating could indirectly be seen as spending money and topping up points, then no matter what he said, even if public opinion criticized him, he wouldn't donate that much. At most, he would take out a few hundred million rmb as a token gesture.

Li Bufan, however, saw that there were endless good things in the system, and these would all be wealth belonging exclusively to him.

Therefore, Li Bufan still decided to spend money, obtain technology, then bring it to reality, earn wealth again, spend money again, obtain technology again, bring it to reality again, earn wealth again... ultimately heading towards the starry sky and the great sea!

This was Li Bufan's idea: to make spending money a virtuous cycle, to make spending money a matter of course.

Although the company was solely owned by Li Bufan, he had a good relationship with his two brothers, so he decided to explain a little.

"Second Brother and Third Brother, I know that 10 billion us dollar, whether for you or for me, is an astronomical figure.

However, you need to know that even if we donate 10 billion us dollar, we still have 10 billion us dollar.

Money, isn't it enough as long as we have enough to spend? What's the use of having so much? You can't bring it with you when you're born, and you can't take it with you when you die."

Also, I plan to take out 10 billion rmb for dividends, which means each of you two can get 100 million yuan before tax.

Of course, although our company does not need to pay taxes in the first year, if the company pays dividends, we will need to pay taxes when we receive them.

But it's still good, we can still keep more than half, and the rest can be considered compensation for not having to pay taxes this year."

When the crowd heard this, they first heard that there was still 10 billion us dollars left, thought about it, and felt it made a lot of sense.

After that, hearing that each of them could get tens of millions in after-tax dividends, they were very excited, their eyes full of little stars, looking at Li Bufan with admiration and even a hint of adoration.

At this time, Li Bufan had to interrupt their fantasies, lest they misunderstand.

After all, everyone still lives under the same roof, seeing each other frequently, and if there were really any such ideas, it would be a nightmare.

"Cough cough.... So, we donate?"

Everyone nodded, expressing their agreement.

"Okay, since we're donating, then we need to plan it carefully.

First, let's select some relatively reliable charitable organizations.

Right, don't just choose those in China, donate a little to foreign ones as well, otherwise our foreign users will complain about us again."

"Hmm, Brother is right.

We need to discuss it carefully."

Subsequently, everyone began to look through the information.

At this moment, Li Bufan thought of a question, why did the system say that directly donating to certain Organizations to indirectly '

krypton 

gold

' (spend money to gain advantage in games) would result in losses.

Because, since it is a donation, the people they want to donate to are naturally those who are truly in need.

Since this is the case, it indicates that some Organizations, more or less, have embezzlement of donations, or use donations to pay staff salaries and reimburse expenses for food, drink, and entertainment.

Therefore, Li Bufan thought, since they are all charitable Organizations, why can't he use that 10 billion us dollars to create his own charitable foundation?

And recruit enthusiastic people from society who want to engage in charitable work.

Regarding their salaries and normal expenses, the company can reimburse them.

In this way, there will be no loss in this charitable foundation, and it can help those who truly need help 100%.

Furthermore, this charitable foundation can publicly disclose every expenditure, accepting supervision from the public.

It's just that, I don't know if the system considers this as recharging?

"system, I want to establish a charitable foundation that does not accept external donations.

And the salaries and expenses of the staff are fully paid by the company, not wasting a single cent, ensuring that every penny is spent properly under the premise of transparency and openness, ensuring that they are used on people or matters that need help.

I don't know if the loss rate will be smaller this way, and also, is this considered '

krypton 

gold

' (spending money to gain advantage in games) recharging?"

The system seemed to pause for a moment, calculating and simulating the situation described by Li Bufan.

After a moment, the system replied coldly.

"Yes, system.

However, in this case, the loss rate also needs to be considered.

As long as you can meet what you just said, it can be considered a recharge.

The system can evaluate your charitable foundation as high-level, which means 99% efficiency, with only 1% loss."

At this time, Li Bufan was very excited.

"Yay, that's great.

Haha, this way we can have a charitable foundation named after the company.

However, the fund manager still needs to be found carefully."

An hour later.

"I choose domestic charitable Organizations for helping people with disabilities, searching for lost children, helping children in impoverished mountainous areas, and foreign charitable Organizations for helping children in Africa."

Wang Huadong first stated the domestic and foreign charitable Organizations he chose.

Subsequently, Bu Changzhuo also added.

"Since Wang Huadong's choices lean towards vulnerable groups such as children and people with disabilities, I think that while focusing on humanities, we should also pay more attention to nature here.

I choose domestic charitable Organizations for wildlife protection, desertification control, sewage treatment, and foreign international charitable Organizations for endangered species protection."

Li Bufan felt a bit awkward hearing what Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong said.

He had previously considered establishing the foundation by himself, but got carried away and forgot to tell them, making them busy for nothing.

"Cough cough... I think what you said is very good.

However, have you noticed a problem?"

Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong shook their heads, indicating that they did not understand Li Bufan's meaning.

Seeing this, Li Bufan directly explained.

"Actually, have you ever thought that the total investment of those charitable Organizations you mentioned might not even be 10 billion us dollars.

If we inject a large sum of money into them, think about it, what is most likely to happen?"

The two seemed to understand something and answered in unison.

"It's embezzlement of donations."

Li Bufan nodded.

"That's right, although the original intention of these charitable Organizations when they were founded was good, we do not know whether their internal structure is corrupt and to what extent it is corrupt.

Think about it, if we donate 10 billion us dollars and find out that 2 billion us dollars, or even more, has been embezzled by some people within the Organization, wouldn't you be angry?"

"Needless to say, I would definitely be angry.

If I encountered it, even once, I would not be willing to donate in the future, and even if I do donate, I would not donate to those Organizations wearing the cloak of charity."

"That's right, so, you see, since we don't know which charitable Organization is good.

Why can't we establish a charitable Organization ourselves?

I think 10 billion us dollars is enough to make this charitable Organization famous globally and help those who truly need help, people or things, right?"

At this moment, everyone realized that this was what Li Bufan meant.

But upon careful thought, it really was the case.

Only with their own charitable Organization can they be 100% sure that every penny is used properly.

Seeing that they all nodded in agreement, Li Bufan waved his hand and said in a deep voice.

"It's decided so happily.

We will donate 10 billion us dollars to this charitable foundation in the name of the company.

We need to find people full of positive energy from society and recruit them to help us manage this charitable foundation.

Their normal expenses and salaries will all be borne by our company.

This foundation temporarily does not accept external donations.

Every penny will be transparently and publicly displayed on the official website regarding its usage, accepting supervision from society."

Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong nodded in agreement upon hearing this.

Just like this, a charitable foundation that would become famous globally in the future, Zhi Gao Charity Foundation, was established.

In the following days, with the approval of the relevant departments, Li Bufan established the Zhi Gao Charity Foundation.

Li Bufan designated an area on the official website specifically for matters related to the charitable foundation.

However, temporarily, only the total amount of 10 billion us dollars for the charitable foundation and a recruitment notice were displayed there.

At the same time, Li Bufan also posted the recruitment notice on the company's Weibo.

The recruitment notice stated:

Dear friends, hello.

Everyone knows that our company has made some money recently.

Yes, quite a lot, I know many people are urging us to donate quickly.

I strongly agree with this.

In order to give back to society, to give back to the China that raised me and the Blue Star that nurtures us, we have made a solemn decision here, we are going to donate 10 billion us dollars.

Yes, you heard correctly, you saw correctly, an unprecedented one-time donation of 10 billion us dollars.

However, we plan to operate it in the form of a charitable foundation funded by the company.

This charitable foundation is called Zhi Gao Charity, hmm, it might sound a bit awkward, but it doesn't matter, as long as you know it's a charitable foundation named after our company.

As the saying goes, a clever housewife cannot cook without rice.

We now have rice but no clever housewife, no suitable fund managers to help us with charitable operations.

Here, we sincerely invite insightful individuals to apply, 1 charitable fund manager, and the manager can form a charitable operation team of no more than 20 people.

Our requirements are that the manager is hardworking, full of positive energy, kind, outgoing, has strong communication and teamwork skills, is sincere, does not embezzle, has no racial discrimination, no bad habits, etc.

We promise that the salary of the manager and their subordinate team will not be less than 20,000 per month, and normal expenses can be reimbursed.

We will publish the usage of the 10 billion us dollars on the official website, down to every cent.

At that time, we invite the general public to come and supervise.

Thank you for your support, dear friends, choose Zhi Gao Software, choose a beautiful future, see you next time.
