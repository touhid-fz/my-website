Chapter 0001:7: Encounter with Miss. Right.



Ever since graduating and starting his company, Li Bufan had been busy with one thing or another, constantly occupied. Occasionally, he would manage to steal a brief moment of leisure from his busy schedule.

After Li Bufan spent a few days with his parents, he found that his inner self was no longer as anxious and restless as before. It seemed to have become much calmer, as if he had found the reason why he worked so hard.

Perhaps it was to repay his parents.

It could be said that all of Li Bufan's achievements were bestowed upon him by his parents. After all, this was what the mighty being who granted him the system had told him!

That's right, although Li Bufan was very wealthy, enough to potentially spend a lifetime without running out according to a normal life.

However, for Li Bufan, ever since he possessed this unique system in the Cosmos, his life trajectory had changed. Neither he himself, nor the system, nor the external environment allowed Li Bufan to live a peaceful life.

He had to diligently develop technology, set his sights on the future, lead the Human race on the journey to the starry sky and the great sea, and spread the footprints of Humanity throughout the entire Cosmos.

Upon arriving at the company, Li Bufan began to think about new products, but for a while, he didn't know what product would be suitable to choose.

Because, if a world-shaking black technology was released, then perhaps the company would be visited by various foreign intelligence personnel the very next day, and even the company's senior management might be secretly kidnapped or assassinated.

However, if it was a common product, such as some ordinary software, it wouldn't be groundbreaking, wouldn't have much competitiveness, wouldn't make too much money, and would be purely for self-amusement and a waste of energy.

Sitting in the spacious and bright Chairman's office, Li Bufan had no ideas for the next product and couldn't help but shake his head.

Li Bufan looked out the window at the bustling avenue with its endless stream of cars and horses. Pedestrians were looking down at their phones, the cries of girls at the shop entrances were constant, and the bus stop signs were broadcasting posters like "wandering blue star."

At this moment, Li Bufan seemed to have thought of something, but he wasn't sure. His gaze drifted towards the distant greenery, and his mind relaxed.

About a quarter of an hour later, his gaze shifted from the distance back to the office. Li Bufan sat back in his Boss's chair, crossed his legs, and looked thoughtful.

Li Bufan first checked the time: 10:46 AM on July 18th.

"Hmm, is it already July 18th? That means we've been resting for three or four days. Fortunately, the company is running normally, and there's no major issue."

"I wonder if Bu Changzhuo and the others have returned to the company."

Thinking of this, Li Bufan made a call.

At this moment, Bu Changzhuo, who was cooking in the kitchen, heard the phone ringing in the living room. He quickly turned on the faucet, washed his hands, then grabbed the rag from the kitchen counter, wiped his hands which were a bit greasy from cooking, and then went to the living room to answer the call.

"Hello, who is it?"

"Cough cough, Second Brother, it's me, Li Bufan. Where are you?"

"Oh, oh, sorry, I'm at home.

I was just cooking in the kitchen, haha, it's my first time cooking for my parents."

"Okay, fine. It's good to spend more time with your parents.

I couldn't tell you were quite filial, even cooking for your parents, haha.

This is good too. If you don't do it now, when the company's business increases later, you'll be busy.

When are you planning to return to the company? I just arrived this morning."

"Hmm, yes. You're back at the company so quickly? I thought we had a seven-day mini-holiday, hehe.

Well, okay, I'll be back at the company within two days at the latest, is that okay?"

"Hmm, that's fine. Anyway, tomorrow and the day after are the weekend, so you can rest well.

You should spend more time with your parents now. Please convey my regards to your uncle and aunt. I won't bother you anymore."

"Okay, sure, thank you Brother. My parents will be very happy to hear your regards. See you at the company the day after tomorrow."

Afterward, Li Bufan hung up the phone and then called Wang Huadong.

Wang Huadong was currently with his parents in their rural hometown, discussing with the village's contractor how to rebuild the house and how to build it to be more beautiful and spacious.

"Ding-a-ling..."

The sound rang out, and Wang Huadong noticed the phone ringing from his pocket, realizing someone was calling him.

He then took it out and saw that it was Brother Li Bufan calling.

So, he walked a little further away from the noisy discussion and answered the phone.

"Brother, hello, is something wrong?"

"Third Brother, where are you now? Why do I faintly hear what sounds like arguing, with both men and women?"

"Uh, this isn't arguing, but discussing.

Well, the sound is indeed a bit loud, I admit that.

I'm currently accompanying my parents back to our rural hometown for a site visit. We plan to tear down the house and rebuild a small Western-style building.

So, I found the village's famous contractor, and we're discussing it with him."

"Hmm, I see, that's fine.

However, for such trivial matters, given your current status, there's no need to haggle over every penny, right?

It's okay to give a little more money and take a small loss yourself, as long as the quality is fine."

"Hmm, that makes a lot of sense.

Alas, my parents have been poor their whole lives. Even now, they still want to split a penny into two. I'm just accompanying my parents for a change of scenery."

"Okay, I understand. I've already returned to the company. I don't require you to come back these two days.

You're far from home, and it's not easy to get back. You should spend a few more days with your parents.

I just contacted Bu Changzhuo, and he said he'll be back at the company the day after tomorrow.

How about you come back on Monday? That would be the morning of the day after tomorrow. The company still needs you very much."

"Oh, like that? Actually, I don't have much going on here. However, since Brother has allowed me, your younger brother, to stay at home for two more days, I'll be thick-skinned and return to the company the day after tomorrow."

"Hmm, that's fine. Then I'll see you the day after tomorrow. You go back to your business."

"Okay, sure, see you the day after tomorrow."

Li Bufan hung up the phone and gently placed it on the office desk. He couldn't help but shake his head. Why were they so unmotivated?

However, it was true that there weren't many things happening at the company recently. Forget it, let them be willful for a while, what harm could it do? After all, it was his company, and he was the one who called the shots.

Unknowingly, it was already 11:30 AM. This was the company's lunch break.

The company regulations stated that morning work hours were from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM, and afternoon work started at 1:30 PM with no set end time. Generally, people would leave work when their tasks were completed.

However, under normal circumstances, most people could leave work before 6:00 PM, but a few people would work overtime until past ten o'clock.

And those who worked overtime until after 9:00 PM would usually receive a free lunch coupon.

The company generally only provided a collective lunch, open to all employees.

It consisted of two meat dishes, one vegetable dish, one soup, and one fruit, sold at cost price of 15 yuan.

The company also had a small dinner supply, but it was generally not open to ordinary employees. Only when the company's senior management needed to work overtime and stay at the company would they inform the kitchen in advance to prepare dinner.

The dining area for the company's lunch was located in the restaurant on the first floor.

To be honest, Li Bufan himself had only eaten there once or twice before, and he hadn't tried all the dishes.

Most of the time, Li Bufan would be relatively extravagant and go with Wang Huadong and Bu Changzhuo to various starred hotels to enjoy delicious food and experience the temptation on their taste buds.

Only occasionally, when they were in a hurry and hadn't contacted a hotel to order in advance, would they eat in the company canteen.

Today, Li Bufan had a sudden impulse and felt that he could take the opportunity of lunch to inspect the company's employees.

So, Li Bufan pressed the elevator button to the first floor.

He saw people walking in groups of two or three, talking and laughing, leaning against each other as they headed towards the canteen hall.

Just then, Li Bufan caught sight of a young girl out of the corner of his eye, heading to the canteen alone.

This made Li Bufan very curious as to why she was going alone, so he looked at the young girl.

He saw the young girl wearing a black tight-fitting long dress, with a slender and graceful figure, about 168 centimeters tall.

Her face seemed to have only light makeup, with slightly noticeable lipstick, but other parts had no concealer. However, her exquisite features were very charming.

A backward glance and a smile, and a hundred charms are born; her body is like a clever swallow, delicate and enchanting. The gentle breeze lightly sways her jade sleeves, and her Xiang skirt trails diagonally, revealing golden lotuses. Her eyebrows are like kingfisher feathers, and her skin is like sheep fat. Her face is set off by peach blossoms, and her hair is piled high with golden phoenix silk. Her autumn eyes are clear and sparkling, with a charming demeanor. Her spring shoots are slender and delicate, with a charming posture. The diagonal red silk floats with colorful brilliance, and the high-pinned pearl and jade ornaments shine brightly.

Just as Li Bufan was staring at the young girl, she turned ninety degrees and her eyes met Li Bufan's.

This made Li Bufan a little embarrassed, but he didn't show any panic or discomfort.

On the contrary, Li Bufan smiled and nodded at her.

Li Bufan's idea was to nod at her to indicate that he, as the Chairman, was aware of this employee.

Employees who knew Li Bufan's true identity would naturally be overjoyed.

But unfortunately, Li Bufan encountered a "silly sweet" girl who really didn't know who the Chairman was.

He saw the girl look at Li Bufan, her eyes seeming a bit unfriendly.

Li Bufan seemed to understand something and walked up generously.

"Hello, beautiful lady, I'm Li Bufan.

Why are you going to the canteen alone?

Look, everyone else around you is in pairs or groups."

“Ah, hello, I’m Liu Yuting.

Because I just came to this company and I’m not familiar with the place, of course I’m alone. Aren’t you too?”

Li Bufan smiled and nodded, then shook his head again.

“Hmm, that makes a lot of sense.

I used to eat with friends, but they have things to do these two days, so I’m eating alone.”

“Oh, I see.”

Just at this moment, for some reason, Li Bufan suddenly said something, but after saying it, Li Bufan couldn’t help but blush and feel embarrassed.

“How about we eat together?”

The young girl was stunned, clearly startled by Li Bufan’s direct words.

However, she seemed to think that since it was in the company and just eating, there was nothing wrong with it. If she refused, it would seem like she wasn’t giving her colleague face, and besides, she was new and needed to get along well with her colleagues.

So, she smiled sweetly and nodded.

“Okay, sure.”

So, the two walked side by side towards the cafeteria.

They each chose the dishes they liked and sat at a table.

The two sat opposite each other, looking at each other while also looking at the food.

The atmosphere suddenly became quiet. Neither of them started eating first, nor did they pick up their chopsticks first. The two just looked at each other, eye to eye.

If someone else looked over, they might even think the two were exchanging affectionate glances and flirting.

After an unknown amount of time, Li Bufan was the first to break the silence.

“Liu Yuting, how about we chat while we eat?

We can each briefly introduce ourselves, then talk about our interests, life experiences, life goals, etc. How about we have a deeper exchange?”

“Ah, oh, okay.”

After the chat started, it never stopped. They would take a bite of food, then chat for a while.

According to their usual eating speed, it wouldn’t take more than ten minutes for either of them to finish.

But today, the two spent a long time and still left about half of their food.

Because, both sides seemed to feel a strong connection with each other and got along very well.

Both were enjoying the conversation and were willing to spend more time with each other, chatting more, discussing life, and exploring international affairs.

Therefore, neither of them was full, but the food had already turned cold, yet neither of them minded.

Unknowingly, only the two of them were left in the restaurant. This made the auntie who was cleaning up the dishes look at them with a bit of an unpleasant expression, seemingly very disapproving of them publicly showing affection.

Finally, Li Bufan asked for her contact information, and she gladly gave it to him.

Then, for some reason, Li Bufan shamelessly said to her.

“Liu Yuting, what time do you get off work this afternoon? How about I treat you to dinner tonight?”

“I get off at 6 o’clock. Ah, that might not be good. After all, we just met.”

“It’s precisely because we just met that we need to talk more. It’s not easy to find a friend you click with, so we should cherish it.”

“Oh, I see. That seems right. Okay then.”

“Okay, then. I’ll contact you at 6 o’clock tonight. I’ll wait for you to get off work.

See you tonight, bye.”

“Okay, see you tonight.”

Liu Yuting’s cheeks were red, which made her feel very embarrassed.

So after speaking, she quickly covered her cheeks and ran to a place far away from Li Bufan.

“Oh my, what’s wrong with me? Am I feeling infatuated?

Although that guy is a bit handsome, but… oh well, let’s just take it one step at a time.

I wonder what will happen tonight? I’m really looking forward to it.”

Li Bufan couldn’t help but smile when he saw Liu Yuting cover her face and run away.

He thought to himself, this girl seems quite shy. This is good too. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date with a girl, and I’m really looking forward to it.

In the afternoon, Li Bufan was restless and didn’t do anything serious. He was thinking about what kind of surprise he should give her tonight.

Li Bufan planned to book a candlelit dinner priced at 28,520 yuan at the most romantic French restaurant in Jiang City.

This candlelit dinner included a bottle of red wine, two steaks, a portion of french fries, two portions of foie gras, a portion of caviar, a fruit and vegetable salad, a portion of escargots, a portion of mushroom cream soup, a portion of borscht, and finally, two portions of pudding and two portions of Häagen-Dazs ice cream.

Although the price was far higher than the actual value of the goods, the advantage of this package was that it was quiet and the service was attentive.

The private room was exquisitely decorated, adorned with various roses, and accompanied by romantic and cheerful love songs.

Li Bufan looked at the online reviews, which were all five-star ratings with pictures and evidence, not like they were faked. Therefore, he decided on this restaurant.

Time passed unknowingly, and it was already 5:50.

Li Bufan looked at the Patek Philippe watch on his left hand and adjusted his clothes in the mirror.

At this time, Li Bufan was wearing a suit, a tie, and leather shoes, looking full of energy.

Then, Li Bufan went to the restroom, washed his face to remove the oil secreted on his face, and felt that he was ready before heading downstairs.

Upon reaching the first floor, it was already 5:58, and then Li Bufan sent Liu Yuting a Micro-Speech message.

“I’m already on the first floor~ I’m waiting for you!”

At this time, Liu Yuting, who had just finished work and was preparing to pack up and go home, saw a Micro-Speech message pop up on her computer desktop.

She quickly opened it to check, afraid it was from her superior, blaming her for not doing her work well.

The result was that it was a message from Li Bufan, which made Liu Yuting both shy and excited.

She hadn’t expected Li Bufan to actually wait for her to get off work as he had said at noon, which touched Liu Yuting a little.

Then she replied, “I’ll be right down,” and continued packing her things before heading downstairs.

Just like that, Li Bufan met Liu Yuting, then called a car online and took a taxi to that French restaurant.

Along the way, Liu Yuting was very curious, not knowing where Li Bufan was taking her to eat.

It wasn’t a fearful shock, but an unexpected exclamation.

She exclaimed at the luxury and romance of the private room and the thoughtfulness of Li Bufan’s preparations.

Then, perhaps something touched a chord in her heart, her heart pounded rapidly, her face was slightly red, and her favorable impression of him soared.

Li Bufan was also very happy to see Liu Yuting looking so cute and chatted and laughed with her.

Perhaps Liu Yuting couldn’t hold her liquor, as less than half a bottle of red wine made her cheeks red and feel a bit weak, walking with a slight sway.

Then, Li Bufan saw her like this and wanted to take her home.

Liu Yuting seemed a bit tipsy at this time, her mind not very clear. Upon hearing that Li Bufan wanted to take her home, she seemed a bit reluctant.

“Can you stay with me? I don’t want to go home today!”

Li Bufan was stunned, feeling a bit awkward and a bit excited.

Then he nodded, carried her on his back to the Hilton next to the restaurant, and checked in.

“Hello, what kind of room would you like to choose? We have single rooms, double rooms, standard rooms, business suites, and a presidential suite.”

Li Bufan saw that Liu Yuting didn’t react and said, “The presidential suite, please. I’ll pay by card.”

The presidential suite in this hotel was very spacious, measuring nearly two hundred square meters. It had two large beds, two small beds, four bedrooms, a kitchen, a conference room, a study, and several bathrooms, etc.

Li Bufan gently placed Liu Yuting on a large bed and looked at her.

“I’ll go to the room next door. You can call me if you need anything tonight.”

Liu Yuting seemed not to hear, neither nodding nor shaking her head.

With Li Bufan’s help, Liu Yuting took off her outer clothes and shoes and socks, covered herself with the blanket, and prepared to sleep.

“Good night, Liu Yuting.”

“Good night, Li Bufan.”

Seeing that Liu Yuting looked a bit tired and wanted to sleep, Li Bufan left the room, gently closed the door, and went to another bedroom.

Since he had drunk some wine and had some alcohol smell on him, plus it was summer and he had sweated, Li Bufan went to the bathroom to wash himself all over.

After taking a shower, just as Li Bufan returned to his room and opened the door.

He found that there seemed to be someone on his bed, completely covered with a blanket.

Li Bufan couldn’t help but be startled, thinking to himself, I didn’t go to the wrong room, did I? Is it haunted?

Then he walked forward, lifted the blanket, and found that it was Liu Yuting.

Liu Yuting seemed to be much more sober. After being discovered, she was a bit embarrassed and shy.

“Um, I’m scared. Can you hold me while I sleep?”

Li Bufan smiled, nodded, then got into the bed and held Liu Yuting.

They spent the night like this, and nothing happened.

The next morning, when she woke up.

Liu Yuting thought that she had actually been held by a man and slept for a night, and her cheeks were flushed.

“Since you held me, you have to be responsible for me all the way.”

“Okay, sure. Then be my girlfriend.”

“Okay!”

The two nestled together, their faces filled with happy smiles.
