Chapter 33: The crew is filming, the hero saves the beauty



After finishing two weeks of studying, experimenting, and writing papers, Li Bufan decided to relax and relieve the pressure of the past few days.

After hearing the news of Li Bufan's "emergence," Liu Yuting was very excited.

Instead of staying in her own company building, she ran to Li Bufan's Chairman's office and became his Chairman's Assistant.

"My dear, you've finally emerged.

What have you been busy with these past few days?"

"Tingting, I've been doing experiments in the Jiangcheng University laboratory these past few days."

Some time ago, the company used artificial intelligence technology to try and develop in other fields, creating software that can predict new materials.

And this software has achieved excellent results, yielding a total of 28 new materials that can be used in many places.

At the time, I couldn't believe it, but my program wouldn't make mistakes.

So, I called the Principal of Jiangcheng University and expressed my desire to borrow the university laboratory for a period of time, hoping for some convenience.

Just like that, I completed these experiments in the laboratory, successfully obtained new materials, and brought the materials back, placing them in the safe in my office.

Afterwards, based on my experimental process, I wrote some papers and submitted them to Science and Nature, hoping they will be accepted.

If all goes well, perhaps my papers will be published within the next few months."

"I see.

Li Bufan, you've worked hard."

I think with your wisdom and reputation, those two magazines will definitely accept them."

"Haha, Tingting, then I'll thank you for your kind words."

"Hehe, you're welcome."

Oh right, why didn't you hand these tasks over to your subordinates?

Instead, you did it all yourself?"

"Oh... that's a good question."

Well, mainly because I don't trust them.

If someone accidentally leaked this information of mine, or registered a patent themselves, wouldn't I be in tears?"

"Hmm, that's true."

But, Li Bufan, can't you monitor them?"

"That's right, I can."

But, if they complete transactions in certain places, for example, in some laboratories within Jiangcheng University, could I really rush in with bodyguards and stop those people?

I think university campuses absolutely do not allow this kind of behavior, even if it's for the right reasons, it's not allowed.

So, after I have my own laboratory in the future, I can arrange some security guards at the entrance and inside the laboratory to stand guard."

"Hmm, that makes sense.

Alright then."

Oh right, since you're almost done being busy, why don't you spend some time with me?

It's been a long time since we went shopping together..."

"Hmm, okay."

But, don't you need to manage Cosmos Film and Television?"

"I do, but it's basically on the right track now.

The recruited crew members and actors are all in place."

Furthermore, the company is no longer short-staffed and can operate normally."

"Oh, I see."

Tsk tsk... In such a short time, you've organized everything so well, that's very good."

"Ah, not at all."

Compared to you, I'm still far behind."

"Alright, let's go.

Let's go shopping today, and tomorrow we can drop by our company to see how they shoot movies, how about that?

I haven't been to a film set before, and I don't know how others shoot movies?

Haha..."

"Hmm, okay, okay."

After speaking, Liu Yuting linked her arm with Li Bufan's, and the two took the elevator downstairs and went to the nearby mall.

......

A few hours later, Li Bufan carried bags large and small, just like last time, feeling both pain and happiness, and then returned home.

"Tingting, how long has it been since you went shopping?

Why did you buy so many things again this time?"

"Hmph!

I'm still a girl, isn't it wrong to like buying clothes?"

"Uh, it seems there's no problem."

"Hehe, then it's fine."

Tonight, I'll cook for you, as a reward for helping me carry clothes all day, okay?"

"Oh?

Tingting, you can cook?

Okay, okay!"

"Hehe, of course."

Just as long as you don't find it unappetizing when the time comes."

Li Bufan's mouth twitched, thinking, could it be some kind of dark cuisine?

But it wasn't good to say something like 'if it's not tasty, I won't eat it', so he just said perfunctorily.

"Hmm, okay, I'll do my best."

......

An hour later, fragrant white rice, three dishes, and one soup were already served on the table.

Li Bufan looked at the dishes on the table, which weren't exactly exquisite but were full of color, aroma, and taste, and still felt very appetizing.

"Li Bufan, I'm done cooking.

You try it first."

"Hmm, okay.

Thank you, darling, for cooking for me, hehe."

Li Bufan picked up a pair of chopsticks, picked up the General Tso's chicken closest to him, and tasted it.

The chicken was tender and juicy, melting in his mouth, softly sweet yet not greasy.

The taste was truly unbelievable.

Liu Yuting looked at Li Bufan.

He was savoring her signature dish, and she also had a look of satisfaction, feeling very happy, and couldn't help but smile softly.

This was the taste of happiness.

Afterwards, Li Bufan tasted the other dishes and gave his evaluation: "Good, good, very good."

The taste is really delicious, I feel very happy."

"Hehe, Li Bufan, I'm happy as long as you like eating it, and I'm also very happy."

After everyone finished eating, they seemed to still want more.

Li Bufan looked at Liu Yuting's fair and delicate face, looked at her graceful and charming figure, and couldn't help but swallow.

Liu Yuting seemed to sense his unusual gaze.

She didn't avoid it, but looked at Li Bufan a little shyly.

"Are you not full?

How about I go to the kitchen and feed you downstairs?"

Li Bufan was stunned, immediately thought of certain suggestive scenes, nodded, and was very happy.

After the two finished bathing, they spent a happy day.

......

The next morning, everyone slowly opened their eyes.

Perhaps due to the nourishment of the previous night and the baptism of love, Liu Yuting became even more mature and charming, making Li Bufan captivated.

Liu Yuting rolled her eyes at him.

"One night wasn't enough?

I'm still a little sore now."

Li Bufan thought so too, feeling a little awkward.

"Hehe."

Where does it hurt, darling?

Do you want your husband to give you a massage?"

"You're annoying, it's already daytime."

Didn't you say yesterday that you wanted to go see the film crew?

It just so happens that I haven't been there for a few days either, to see how they're progressing.

Are you coming with me?"

"Oh oh, okay, I'll go with you."

"Hmm, then hurry up and get out of bed, what are you lazing around for!"

"Ah, okay, hehe."

......

The two arrived at the filming location and saw security personnel around, who had set up a cordon to keep spectators away and prevent accidents.

After Liu Yuting showed her identification, the two were allowed to enter the filming location.

Director Zhang, who was resting nearby, saw Liu Yuting walking over and was very excited, wanting to go forward and get closer to her to make a good impression for future filming work.

As he got closer, Director Zhang saw Li Bufan, was stunned for a moment, not knowing where this greenhorn came from.

My goodness, he was even holding Madam Liu's hand, which made him a bit confused.

"Hello Madam Liu, I am Director Zhang, the director of 'Blue Star Defense War'."

May I ask, who is this?"

After speaking, he looked at Li Bufan.

Liu Yuting looked at the scene.

Everyone didn't seem to be filming, but were chatting and eating snacks.

Facing Director Zhang, she slowly spoke.

"Hello Director Zhang, this is my boyfriend, the Chairman of Zhi Gao Software, and also a major shareholder of Cosmos Film and Television, Li Bufan."

When Director Zhang first heard he was her boyfriend, he couldn't help but feel a little jealous.

Afterwards, when he heard he was the Chairman of Zhi Gao Software and a major shareholder of Cosmos Film and Television, he immediately backed down.

He also felt that it was true; it seemed only someone with this status could be worthy of Madam Liu.

Then, Director Zhang smiled at Li Bufan and extended his hand, "So it's General Manager Li, a pleasure to meet you."

Li Bufan was also slightly stunned, shook hands with him, and then nodded.

"Hmm, Director Zhang, hello.

I've seen many of your previous films, they're very good."

Director Zhang was still a little excited to hear words praising him, "Haha, not at all, not at all, Mr. Li, you flatter me."

Liu Yuting spoke at this moment: "Director Zhang, I'd like to ask why those actors and crew members aren't filming?

What's the situation now, slacking off?"

Director Zhang was startled by her aura, quickly shook his head, and denied it: "Madam Liu, you've misunderstood."

Everyone just finished filming a segment, and now it's break time.

The next segment will start filming in 15 minutes.

Filming also requires a balance between work and rest, doesn't it?"

Hearing this, Liu Yuting nodded and looked at Li Bufan: "Li Bufan, since they're resting now, how about we go over there to see those stars and chat with them?"

Li Bufan nodded and, holding hands with Liu Yuting, went to the hall where the stars were resting.

However, it seemed like something significant had happened, as the scene seemed a bit out of control.

He saw a young man holding a bouquet of flowers, running up to the female lead, kneeling on one knee, looking at the girl with fervent eyes, and shouting excitedly.

"Zhang Qian, I love you."

Do you know, ever since the day I watched the casting livestream and saw your breathtakingly beautiful face, I was deeply captivated by you.

I used to not believe what others said about love at first sight.

But ever since the day I saw you, I've been thinking about you day and night, wishing I could marry you and bring you home soon."

Zhang Qian, can you give me a chance? I swear, I will cherish you well, and I will only love you one person my whole life. I love you, Zhang Qian.”

Zhang Qian was also startled by the student's behavior, not knowing if it was 

move 

or not daring to move. She just stood there foolishly, motionless.

Meanwhile, Li Bufan, who was standing aside, saw this person and seemed to recall the internet's former 'National Husband'. Then he took a closer look.

Nani, isn't this Wang Shichong?

And some of the other actors nearby, at this time, seemed to recognize this expert in romance, whispering to each other and letting Zhang Qian hear.

Zhang Qian might have genuinely felt a bit touched at first, but later, hearing the crowd's comments, and then looking at his appearance, she connected him to the person rumored online.

Immediately, her eyes sharpened, and she looked at Wang Shichong, shaking her head, sighing, and speaking softly.

“To be honest, if you weren't Wang Shichong himself, I might have agreed to try dating you. But, as you know, netizens say you are an expert in romance who toys with women's feelings.

I don't know if it's true or false, but I know this kind of thing doesn't come from nowhere. If it were groundless, there wouldn't be so many so-called 'victims' arguing with you online.

So, I'm sorry, I cannot accept your kindness. Don't be discouraged either; I know you are actually a good person, and I hope you can meet a better girl than me in the future.”

After speaking, Zhang Qian shook her head and walked away.

Wang Shichong's face was ashen. He hadn't expected that even after extensive makeup, everyone could still recognize him. He would fire the makeup artist when he got back.

At this moment, he looked at the crowd, ignoring Li Bufan and Liu Yuting, who looked like college students. He realized that not many people on the scene were richer than his family.

So, hardening his heart, he dropped the bouquet and decided to use force directly. If the soft approach didn't work, he would go for the hard one.

He chased after Zhang Qian.

Zhang Qian heard the screams of some actresses, was startled, and turned back to see Wang Shichong chasing after her. She never expected him to be like this.

She was very surprised and also very scared, quickly shouting and running forward.

Li Bufan and Liu Yuting looked at each other at this time, seeing a hint of killing intent in each other's eyes.

Li Bufan and Liu Yuting immediately called their bodyguards, telling them to come quickly.

At this moment, seeing that Wang Shichong was about to catch up to Zhang Qian, Li Bufan roared.

“Wang Shichong, stop right there!”

Wang Shichong was startled and stopped. He almost thought his dad had arrived, then he remembered this seemingly childish voice didn't sound like a middle-aged person.

Then he turned around and saw Li Bufan walking towards him. His face was ugly. He realized he had been tricked and couldn't help but question.

“Who are you? How dare you be presumptuous in front of me?”

Li Bufan looked at him and teased with a smile.

“Oh, I'm not, you are the scallion.”

Wang Shichong was startled, thinking of his name, Wang Shichong, I am a scallion, and then he was very angry, looking at Li Bufan.

“Kid, don't meddle in other people's business. If you know what's good for you, scram.”

Li Bufan laughed.

“Oh? Do you really dare to do such a despicable thing in broad daylight today? Or rather, forcibly abduct a civilian girl under everyone's gaze?”

Wang Shichong was panicked by the words, but he didn't back down.

“What, do you dare to interfere? Since you know who I am, you should know the power of our family. Be careful that for the rest of your life, you'll be in prison... No, perhaps, you might encounter a car accident one day and won't have a rest of your life, hehe.”

Li Bufan's heart tightened, and he seemed to have a dangerous premonition, which greatly puzzled Li Bufan, but he didn't give up.

“No, you wouldn't dare. Because, you see, there is surveillance above you, and every word you just said has been recorded. Every word you say next could be used as evidence against you in court.”

Wang Shichong was greatly enraged, pointing at Li Bufan and saying.

“Kid, who exactly are you?”

“Haha, I am Li Bufan, Chairman of Zhi Gao Software. If you have the guts, retaliate. I'm waiting. If something happens to me, everything you said today will be used as testimony and presented in court to sue you... Haha, I'd like to see today if you want to go down fighting...”

“Li Bufan, right, I've remembered you. You just wait for me.”

“Haha, I'm waiting for your good news. Get lost quickly.”

After speaking, Wang Shichong also knew that this matter could not be resolved peacefully today. Feeling very gloomy, he left the place.

Li Bufan walked in front of Zhang Qian.

“Hi, Zhang Qian, are you okay?”

Perhaps it was because of Li Bufan's heroic act of saving the beauty and driving away the annoying fly that made her very excited. When she saw Li Bufan, she ran over directly and hugged him tightly.

Li Bufan was completely stunned, thinking, what is going on? His girlfriend is still watching nearby.

Just as Li Bufan was about to push her away, Zhang Qian started crying directly, sobbing and saying to Li Bufan.

“

Woohoo

... Thank you, thank you for helping me today. I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't come.”

Her crying immediately made Li Bufan feel a bit soft-hearted. Then he also hugged her and gently patted her back, saying softly.

“Zhang Qian, don't cry. It's my duty to help you. It's something every gentleman with a sense of justice would do.”

“No, it's not like that. Some people would be afraid of his retaliation and wouldn't dare to anger him. Otherwise, in the past, he wouldn't have pursued so many rumored girlfriends.

But today, I only saw you standing up, only you dared to be a hero saving the beauty.

Hehe, I never thought that one day, I would be like Snow White in a fairy tale, encountering danger and being rescued by a Prince Charming who came running. I am truly touched. Ah, I realize I seem to have fallen for you. What should I do?”

After speaking, Zhang Qian hugged him even tighter, burying her head in Li Bufan's chest, seemingly enjoying it very much.

At this moment, Li Yuting walked over, her face very unpleasant, which made Li Bufan's heart a mess, fearing a misunderstanding.

“Cough cough... Uh, Zhang Qian. You'd better not fall for me. We are not familiar yet.”

“It's okay, we'll get familiar now. Feelings can be cultivated.”

“Cough cough... Uh, my girlfriend is here today. Yes, right next to you. Can you let go of me?”

Zhang Qian let out a surprised “Ah,” as if very shy, quickly released her hands, then ran to the side, covering her mouth and giggling, as if quietly watching the judgment Li Bufan was about to receive.

Li Bufan suddenly felt a great sense of foreboding and was very speechless. He thought, if you were going to let go, you shouldn't have done it when Liu Yuting was almost next to me. How am I supposed to explain this to her?

Li Bufan felt a little awkward, looking at Liu Yuting.

“Cough cough... Uh, well, it's a misunderstanding, yes, right, it's a misunderstanding.”

Liu Yuting seemed a bit angry.

“Hmph! They all say men are big pig trotters, eating what's in the bowl and looking at what's in the pot. I see, it's not false at all. Tell me, are you having an affair with Zhang Qian?”

Li Bufan's head immediately shook like a rattle drum, shaking non-stop.

“No, no, how could that be? Tingting, listen to my explanation. Hey, Zhang Qian over there, stop giggling. Come over here and help me explain, okay? Please.”

Zhang Qian seemed very embarrassed, her face flushed. She looked at Liu Yuting and realized it was the CEO of Cosmos Film and Television who had interviewed her last time, which made her a little awkward.

After all, she relied on their company for work, and now, in front of her, she was flirting with her boyfriend. It was too embarrassing.

“I'm sorry, Ms. Liu. I, I... and Mr. Li Bufan, only met for the first time today. He helped me, and I was very happy, so I hugged him. There was nothing else.”

“Then why did you hug him and bury your head in his chest with a look of enjoyment?”

“That's because I like him, of course. Oh, I'm sorry, I misspoke, a slip of the tongue. I admire him, not like him.”

Li Bufan, standing nearby, heard Zhang Qian's explanation, and his face got darker the more he listened. Good heavens, is a girl's IQ negative when she's infatuated?

Ah, how am I going to explain this to Liu Yuting? It's a headache.

Liu Yuting nodded at Zhang Qian, then said something astonishing, joking and whispering to her.

“You really don't like him? What if I'm willing to share him with you?”

“Wow, Sister, are you that good? Oh, no, you must be lying to me, right? 

Woohoo

, you bad person, why are you lying to me?”

Well, Liu Yuting was indeed a bit suspicious of deceiving her, but she also hadn't expected Zhang Qian to start crying directly. She immediately understood Li Bufan's expression earlier. It was truly as awkward as could be.

“Uh, Zhang Qian, let's not mention this, okay? Let's just pretend nothing happened today?”

“Ah, this... Oh, sigh, alright then. It's a pity, I can't be your good sister.”

Li Bufan's face was full of black lines at this time, greatly surprised by what the two girls were saying.

Later, the crew resumed normal filming, and everything continued as usual. For now, no accidents happened.
