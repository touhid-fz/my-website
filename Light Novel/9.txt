Chapter 9: The Birth of Unicorn Companies



Early the next morning, many delivery express services delivered the purchased goods to the ground floor of the Zhi Gao Software Building.

Then the delivery personnel began to organize and move them into the building one by one.

Fortunately, there was an elevator, so the delivery personnel didn't have to carry them up one by one.

At this time, Li Bufan and his party of three stood downstairs of the office building, watching many delivery personnel busily moving goods with smiles on their faces.

Because they could soon work in their offices and have their own offices.

Li Bufan thought of the previous recruitment and asked Bu Changzhuo, "Second Brother, how is the recruitment progressing now? How many people have you found?"

Hearing about the recruitment, Bu Changzhuo seemed quite satisfied.

"Currently, we have recruited 3 HR, 4 finance, 5 operations, 3 secretaries, 4 graphic designers, and a total of 12 people for some other positions."

"Oh, right, regarding the recruitment of programmers, I wasn't sure if I should make the decision for you.

However, I have roughly selected some; among the 115 resumes, there are 6 excellent ones, 35 above average, and the rest are average or below.

I have contacted the above average and excellent candidates, and they said they are available for further interviews at any time.

What do you think, do you want to talk to them?"

"Okay, got it.

When do you plan to have the people you've already recruited come to the office?"

Now is the time when everything is just starting.

The office building has just been leased, many things have not been installed and debugged, and it also needs a good cleaning, so it's exactly the time when various manual labor is needed.

Regarding the 41 good programmers you mentioned, how about this, let them come here this afternoon.

It is estimated that by the afternoon, the office building will be mostly cleaned and ready for occupancy."

"Okay, I notified them last night to come this morning.

A few people have already arrived, but they were embarrassed seeing so many delivery personnel and are waiting nearby.

For example, in your 10 o'clock direction, those two girls are HR, and also, in your 2 o'clock direction, there are 2 men and 2 women; they are finance or secretaries.

There are also some people who are already on their way; should I notify them to come now?

Also, regarding the recruitment of the 41 programmers, I'll add you to the group, and you can talk to them."

"Okay, okay, I see, they are indeed here.

Alright, let them come over; today will be considered their first day of work.

Then add me to the group; that's it."

"Okay, okay, sure."

After Li Bufan entered the group chat, he changed the group name to Zhi Gao Software Programmer Recruitment.

Then he sent a big red envelope of 100 yuan with the words "I am the CTO, interviews today."

...

In a certain breakfast shop in Jiang City, there was a disheveled young man eating tofu pudding while browsing Weibo, when he suddenly saw a red envelope notification.

"Huh, a red envelope, when did I join this group?

Oh, I remember, it seems to be the group of the company that was recruiting online before.

Wow, a 6.85 yuan red envelope, the Boss is quite generous.

Ah?

It says interviews today, oh dear.

Time is a bit tight, I should hurry home, take a shower, clean myself up, and then prepare for the interview."

...

At this time, the group was instantly filled with messages saying "Thank you, Boss."

Li Bufan couldn't help but shake his head when he saw their messages; they were indeed right, he really was the Boss, haha.

Then, Li Bufan thought for a moment and edited a message to send to the group.

"Hello everyone, elites.

I am the CTO of Zhi Gao Software.

I plan to meet with everyone at 2 p.m. this afternoon at the Zhi Gao Software office building.

Please go to the meeting room on the 2nd floor, and we will discuss together.

Don't worry, the interview won't be very difficult.

You have already been initially screened, so I won't talk about professional knowledge today.

After this, I will mainly consider everyone comprehensively based on learning ability, desire to learn, personal character, and fit with the company."

At this time, someone asked, "May I quietly ask, where is the Zhi Gao Software Building?"

Li Bufan was startled, realizing that this was still the new name his three brothers gave to this building.

So he thought about the address here, sent it over, then took a photo, and sent a location.

Then he sent a poll in the group: Can you come to the interview on time this afternoon?

Immediately, all 41 people in the poll chose yes.

Seeing this, Li Bufan was very satisfied and said, "See you this afternoon."

Just then, Bu Changzhuo hurried to Li Bufan.

"Mr. Yang and Mr. Zhu, this is the founder and Chairman of our Zhi Gao Software, Li Bufan.

Brother, these two claim to be from Sequoia Capital."

Li Bufan frowned slightly, not expecting that these capital predators would detect the excellence of the product so quickly.

However, Li Bufan did not refuse immediately, wanting to hear their views on the product and the company.

So, Li Bufan greeted them with a smile and shook hands with them one by one.

"Hello, I am the founder of Zhi Gao Software.

May I ask what brings you here?"

"Haha, young man, you have a future.

You've done so well just starting a business, and you've leased the office building for 3 years.

This is probably not cheap, right?

Presumably, your company doesn't have much capital left, does it?"

Li Bufan's face turned ugly; he didn't expect them to investigate so thoroughly, which surprised him about the intelligence gathering capabilities of these capitalists.

Li Bufan kept a straight face, not getting angry.

"I am still very busy.

Since you are not stating the purpose of your visit, I will not see you out.

Goodbye."

The two men were stunned, not expecting this young man to be so vigilant.

However, thinking that this task was assigned to them by the Boss, failing to complete the Boss's instructions would probably not end well.

If they successfully completed it, there would be a lot of bonuses and beautiful women.

Mr. Zhu spoke first, "Li, don't be in such a hurry.

Since you are busy, let's make a long story short.

We at Sequoia Capital think your company has great potential and want to invest."

Li Bufan nodded and asked, "May I know what price your side can offer?"

Seeing that Li Bufan seemed willing to accept investment, Mr. Zhu intensified his offensive and said, "200 million yuan for fifteen percent of the shares.

This is equivalent to you not having to do anything and getting assets worth hundreds of millions, which is enough for you to spend a lifetime.

What do you think?

Do you agree?

If you agree, we can sign the contract today.

Once the contract is signed, we can transfer the funds."

Li Bufan shook his head, his face turning cold, and replied to Mr. Zhu with a firm tone, "Sorry for your kind offer.

We will not sell shares."

Seeing Li Bufan's attitude change 180 degrees at this time, Mr. Zhu realized the situation was not good, so he quickly tried to persuade him, "If you are not satisfied with our offer, we can discuss it further.

Furthermore, you need to know that your company doesn't have much capital now.

You don't even know if it can last for a few months; at that time, the personnel salaries might drag you down.

Besides, with our investment, on a personal level, you can not only use hundreds of millions of funds as your private property.

From the project perspective, you will have funds to expand significantly and seize the market.

Moreover, we at Sequoia Capital will also help you behind the scenes.

When your company goes public, we can also help you operate; at that time, you might become the number one financial talent in Jiang City.

How about it, think about it?

This is also beneficial to you."

Li Bufan still shook his head and flatly refused, "Impossible."

Mr. Yang, who was next to him, saw this and directly questioned Li Bufan, "Kid, don't refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit.

Let's both take a step back; you give a company valuation, and we want to occupy fifteen percent or more of the shares."

Li Bufan shook his head, then nodded, and said, "How I run my company, whose investment I accept, or whether I accept anyone's investment, is my freedom.

Of course, I am not an unreasonable person; if you accept a valuation of 100 billion us dollar, I will agree to you purchasing fifteen percent of the shares for 15 billion us dollar."

At this time, Mr. Zhu and Mr. Yang's faces turned green, feeling insulted.

They both said, "Kid, don't ask for too much.

Your offer is simply a fantasy!"

Li Bufan snorted and sneered, "In that case, please leave.

I won't see you out."

After speaking, Li Bufan ignored the two of them, turned his head directly, and walked forward.

Mr. Zhu and Mr. Yang looked at each other, then shook their heads, thinking the offer was too outrageous.

In this situation, they couldn't complete the task, and it wasn't their fault; it was truly because the founder didn't know what was good for him.

They secretly hoped that the Boss would not blame them.

...

At this moment, in California, United States, Zuckerberg sat in his office, looking at the Smart Mutual Translation software, his mood heavy.

Because, just a few hours ago, he had a meeting with the Board of Directors members about whether to use 20 billion us dollars to reach a strategic cooperation agreement with the company behind this software.

Out of the 17 members of the Board of Directors, 5 agreed, 8 disagreed, and 4 abstained.

Among them, the Board of Directors members who agreed held 32% of the voting rights, those who disagreed held 47%, and those who abstained held 21%.

Ultimately, the resolution was rejected based on the principle of minority rule by the majority.

But Zuckerberg, as a young person, understood their preferences very well.

Many people were willing and even liked to communicate and interact with foreigners, but due to language barriers, they couldn't communicate well.

For example, he himself usually learned a few Chinese phrases with his wife, chatted about military matters from "The Art of War," and discussed the long and rich history of Great China over five thousand years.

After the previous Board of Directors meeting, Zuckerberg specifically communicated with the few people who supported him.

They believed that it wasn't a short-term threat, but in the long run, it was very likely to attract away Facebook's loyal users.

The few of them discussed it and found that there wasn't a particularly good way to persuade the Board of Directors.

However, a certain Jew came up with a method that wasn't really a method, which was a betting agreement.

He suggested to Zuckerberg: "Mr. Zuckerberg, as you know, those damned capitalists on the Board of Directors couldn't possibly take such a large sum of money out of their own pockets.

However, if there was a situation where their investment was not only recovered but even exceeded, they might willingly agree."

"The parties to this betting agreement are you and the shareholders of the rest of the Board of Directors."

"The agreement is to pay 20 billion us dollars to reach a strategic cooperation agreement with the development company of the Smart Mutual Translation software, have them provide an interface, integrate it into our Facebook products, and operate it for three months, with these three months serving as an observation period."

"The agreement stipulates: Your winning condition is that after three months, Facebook's market value increases by more than 5%, which is reaching 525 billion us dollars.

Your losing condition is that if the 5% growth is not achieved within three months, you voluntarily sell all the shares in your possession to the Board of Directors members at 50% of the market price."

"Presumably, the vampires on the Board of Directors will be very happy to pay.

How about it, my dear Mr. Zuckerberg, what do you think of my suggestion?"

At first, Zuckerberg thought the Jew was doing him a favor, but it turned out he had dug a big pit, forcing him to jump into it.

"Damn it, Derek, I think you're even more ruthless than those vampires.

Forget it, I admit defeat, I'm willing to bet with you.

But I believe that after the cooperation, our market value will definitely increase significantly."

"Haha, my dear Zuckerberg, saying that really hurts my feelings.

I also hope our Facebook market value will increase significantly.

Alright, I won't chat with you anymore, I need to go talk to those old fellows on the Board of Directors.

Afterwards, we'll hold another Board of Directors meeting, and presumably by then they will all agree to the betting agreement you proposed."

Zuckerberg's face was grim, but he could do nothing about it, so he nodded in agreement and then returned to his office.

Meanwhile, far away in Jiang City University Science and Technology Park, several luxury cars appeared at this time.

A middle-aged man got out of a Maybach, he seemed to know that Li Bufan was the Chairman, so he walked forward with a smile.

"Mr. Li, hello.

I am Zhang Wenqiang, Deputy Director of the Investment Department of Tencent Group."

When Li Bufan heard Tencent Group, he thought about it and realized he really didn't know Tencent also had an Investment Department.

Perhaps, those big companies had too much money and didn't know how to spend it, so they could only invest.

"Mr. Zhang, hello.

Let's not beat around the bush, it's good for everyone.

Previously, Sequoia Capital wanted to exchange 200 million for fifteen percent of the shares, but I refused.

I wonder what your offer is?"

The man was stunned, he didn't expect Sequoia Capital to have come first.

But thinking that his Big Boss said it was a 1 billion acquisition, it made him a little embarrassed.

Li Bufan saw his face turn grim, then slowly redden.

He understood immediately, they planned to get the shares at a lower price.

So he shook his head and said coldly: "Since that's the case, goodbye."

Then he left without looking back.

Besides the beginning, the man didn't say another word before being rejected by Li Bufan.

This made him lose a lot of face, and he developed some hostility towards Li Bufan, then snorted coldly and went back to report.

There were also two cars in the distance, and they actually knew they were from the investment industry.

However, seeing their unhappy expressions as they parted ways, they were a little at a loss.

So, the people in those two cars got out simultaneously, met, and discussed with each other how to reach an investment intention with Li Bufan.

Li Bufan saw that the goods were almost unloaded and it was about to finish, he was very happy, and just as he was thinking about when he could finally sit on the Boss's chair in the Chairman's office today, he was interrupted by two people.

"I am Wang Lina (Ouyang Shaogong), I am from Goldman Sachs (NetEase) Investment.

I would like to inquire if Chairman Li's esteemed company accepts investment."

Li Bufan turned his head and saw a man and a woman, representing different investment capital respectively.

Then Li Bufan nodded and said: "Hello, you may speak."

Wang Lina replied first: "Mr. Li is truly young and promising.

At such a young age, you have founded a unicorn enterprise, it's truly remarkable.

Of course, it's a startup after all, although the product is perfect, the company needs funding everywhere during its operation, and this is where our investment company comes into play.

After continuous discussions among Goldman Sachs executives, the valuation given to your company is 1 billion us dollars.

We want to use 500 million us dollars to own 49% of the shares and hope to get priority for future investments."

Ouyang Shaogong was greatly surprised to hear Wang Lina's words and felt utterly ashamed.

Because the suggestion given by the executives of their Investment Department was to acquire the entire company for 500 million.

So, Ouyang Shaogong shook his head and said nothing, because speaking would only bring humiliation, it was better not to speak.

Seeing this, Li Bufan was very interested in Goldman Sachs Investment.

Because this was currently the highest valuation and the most sincere offer.

But Li Bufan still wouldn't agree, after all, his goal was a scale of hundreds of billions of us dollars.

So, Li Bufan smiled and said: "Miss Wang, Goldman Sachs Investment is indeed very sincere.

However, I have sufficient funds and am capable of independent development.

Therefore, your investment is not needed for the time being.

Of course, I highly regard the vision of the Goldman Sachs Investment executives.

Because, among the investment companies I've met today, only your side said our company is a unicorn enterprise.

I am very happy about this.

I believe we will have opportunities to cooperate in the future.

If investment is needed later, I will contact you proactively then.

I wonder what Miss Wang thinks?"

Wang Lina smiled, nodded, and said: "Haha, of course, no problem.

We think highly of you as a person and hope to have the opportunity to cooperate in the future.

However, Mr. Li, as someone with experience, let me give you a piece of advice.

You can't earn all the money in the world, you can't earn everything by yourself, that way you won't have friends.

Alright, this is my business card, you can contact me if you need anything in the future."

Li Bufan nodded, saw Wang Lina and Ouyang Shaogong leave one after another, and while playing with the business card, walked towards the office building.

Li Bufan looked at the metallic business card with gold edges, it was very high-end, and he secretly praised Goldman Sachs Capital.

At this moment, Li Bufan's heart was filled with ambition, and he made up his mind to earn the most money in the future and make his company the greatest company in the world.

A unicorn enterprise generally refers to a high-tech enterprise with a market value exceeding 1 billion us dollars.

At this time, there were less than 10,000 such companies in the entire Greater China region, while the total number of companies was close to 100 million.

This means that Li Bufan's company has already surpassed 99.99% of the companies in China.

However, you have to eat one bite at a time, and walk one step at a time.

He will work hard slowly and eventually become a true trillionaire with trillions in assets.
