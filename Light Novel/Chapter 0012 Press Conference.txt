Chapter 0012: Press Conference



At 6:30 AM on July 5th, while everyone was still asleep, Li Bufan knocked on Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong's doors.

"Everyone, get up! I have something important to tell you today. It's not about a small goal of 100 million, but a big project worth hundreds of billions."

Bu Changzhuo was originally dreaming of the beautiful face and lovely figure of his first love and didn't want to be disturbed.

At first, he was very angry and had a bit of a morning temper, but when he heard 'hundreds of billions,' he couldn't help but swallow hard, quickly got out of bed, put on his clothes, and opened the door.

Li Bufan saw that both of them were dressed.

So, he had them sit at the table in the living room.

"Are you curious about what I mean by hundreds of billions?"

They nodded, and Bu Changzhuo asked, "Are you talking about our company's market value?"

Li Bufan shook his head, not intending to let them guess further, and directly revealed the truth.

"Second Brother and Third Brother, if nothing unexpected happens tomorrow, our company will sign a cooperation agreement worth tens of billions at a press conference.

As for the company we are signing with, it is Facebook from Silicon Valley.

Today, their CEO, Zuckerberg, will personally come to Jiang City to discuss cooperation with us.

According to the agreement between him and me, we will receive 20 billion US dollars.

Of course, we will provide Facebook with the exclusive right to use our Smart Mutual Translation software, embedding our functionality as a plugin into Facebook's software."

At this moment, the two of them looked at Li Bufan, their eyes filled with little stars, very excited.

"Ahem... They will arrive at the airport this morning, so we should prepare well.

Afterward, the company also needs a little cleaning, and the conference room and tea need to be prepared."

"Wow, that's great. Brother, you are amazing. A big shot from TV will actually come to cooperate with us, haha."

"Yes, yes. I really never expected it. I originally thought Zuckerberg was very strong, but now that I think about it, Brother is even more amazing."

Li Bufan listened to their flattering words, scratched his head, and chuckled foolishly.

......

At eight o'clock in the morning, after arriving at the company, they gathered all the employees.

They told them that there would be foreign visitors visiting the company today, and that they should perform well, but not be too deliberate or artificial; they should show their hospitality and professionalism.

Upon hearing this, everyone agreed.

However, some people below were still muttering, "I wonder which foreigner it is?"

Li Bufan thought for a moment and decided to just tell the truth, then he signaled to Bu Changzhuo with his eyes and nodded at him.

Bu Changzhuo understood and said, "Everyone, next, we will be welcoming Mr. Zuckerberg from Facebook.

He will inspect our company, and perhaps a strategic cooperation will be reached.

This requires everyone's serious cooperation; I don't want anyone to drop the ball at a critical moment."

Everyone felt it was incredible, that it was the legendary Facebook CEO, and then they thought of the company's unique product, and their faces were filled with satisfied smiles, feeling that this company had a lot of potential.

Afterward, Li Bufan and his two companions explained what they needed to do next and assigned the tasks.

Then, Li Bufan first went to a nearby printing shop to print and customize a welcome sign for them so they could see the three of them after getting off the plane.

Then, the three of them hailed a car and took a taxi to Jiang City Airport.

After talking to Zuckerberg earlier, Li Bufan added him as a friend on Facebook and asked him about their flight number and approximate arrival time.

Zuckerberg took a photo and sent it to Li Bufan.

At this moment, Li Bufan was looking at the photo on his phone while also looking at the flight numbers on the LED screen.

A few minutes later, Li Bufan found the flight number, JC468, which was scheduled to arrive at the airport at 9:58.

And it was already 9:50, so Li Bufan called to the two of them to follow him, holding the pick-up sign and heading to the pick-up area.

Zuckerberg was very restless on the way.

Because he didn't know the outcome of the cooperation.

Furthermore, Zuckerberg was shocked to see the skyscrapers in Jiang City, as it didn't match the poverty and backwardness reported by foreign media.

The plane slowly descended and landed on the runway.

Zuckerberg and his entourage got off the plane.

Then Zuckerberg saw his name written by Li Bufan, as well as the words welcoming him to Jiang City.

Zuckerberg realized that this was Li Bufan's consideration for him, not wanting him to be discovered, and he was very satisfied with this point.

Li Bufan looked at the landed plane but didn't see Zuckerberg, feeling a little strange.

He thought, did Zuckerberg lie to him? Probably not, he was just a nobody now, was there a need to deceive him?

Just at this moment, Zuckerberg and his entourage walked up to him.

Because Zuckerberg was wearing sunglasses, it was hard to distinguish from a distance, and only now did Li Bufan recognize Zuckerberg from his outline.

So Li Bufan shook hands with Zuckerberg and introduced himself, then invited them to visit the company.

Zuckerberg indicated that he understood and agreed to follow Li Bufan to the Zhi Gao Software Building.

Just at this moment, a paparazzi took a photo of this scene.

"Editor-in-chief King, I have big news, do you want it? I want 50,000 for the tip-off, cash on delivery."

"Little Cao, what news?"

"To be honest, I was just staking out at Jiang City Airport.

I saw Zuckerberg get off the plane and shake hands with a young man in his twenties.

I have photos.

How about this news, is it explosive enough? Give me the money, and I'll send you the photos."

"Okay, 50,000 has been transferred to your payment account, check it."

"Hehe, Editor-in-chief, you're a good sport.

I've sent the photos to your Micro-Speech, check them out."

At this time, the Editor-in-chief opened Micro-Speech and saw a foreigner wearing sunglasses shaking hands with a young man.

And from this photo, Zuckerberg's face could be clearly seen, although he was wearing sunglasses, after analyzing it, it was indeed Zuckerberg.

However, he didn't know who this mysterious young man was to receive such favor from Zuckerberg.

"What's a good headline? Hmm, right, didn't Facebook once cooperate with companies in China, wanting to capture the domestic market? Then let's go with this."

"Zuckerberg Visits China, Facebook May Enter the Domestic Market?"

"The Story Between a Mysterious Young Man and Zuckerberg That Must Be Told."

"Tsk tsk, this is a good headline, catchy."

The Editor-in-chief praised himself, and then began to forward this news.

Soon, this news spread rapidly and then dominated the trending topics on Weibo.

"Really, is it true, isn't Facebook blocked in China?"

"Maybe it's true, didn't you notice that young man?"

"Yeah, what's the identity of that young man? Is he the legendary rich second generation?"

"Hehe, hasn't Facebook always wanted to seize the domestic market, maybe there's some result.

Perhaps the social market will soon see a situation of one superpower and many strong players."

......

Meanwhile, Li Bufan and his group were taking Zuckerberg and his entourage into the company, completely unaware of the online discussion.

The company employees were very curious when they saw a group of foreigners, and then when they saw Zuckerberg, two girls started screaming.

Li Bufan shook his head and turned to Zuckerberg.

"Mr. Zuckerberg, please forgive me.

I didn't tell them you were coming, it seems those girls are your fans, haha."

"Haha, it's okay, I can understand."

Afterward, everyone sat in the conference room, and Li Bufan had the secretaries pour tea and place it in front of them.

Zuckerberg said, "Everyone, let's discuss the technical feasibility.

We have two senior Facebook engineers here, who will you be sending from your side?"

Li Bufan volunteered, brought his prepared computer, and showed the Smart Mutual Translation software development tools to the two engineers, answering their questions as they arose.

"Oh my goodness, it's amazing.

Li, you created your own programming language and completed its compilation.

You even created a brand new IDE tool from it, and it can export and generate multiple versions of software or applications.

Oh my goodness, I can hardly imagine how you did something so complex."

Li Bufan was a little embarrassed, rubbed his nose, and said, "Well, I started this plan a long time ago.

These are the results of several years of hard work, and I only had a breakthrough recently."

Zuckerberg saw Li Bufan and the engineers talking enthusiastically, and although he didn't understand some of the technical terms, he was very curious to see their faces full of smiles.

"Mr. Li, what are you discussing?

Lawrence, how was your discussion with Mr. Li, is it technically feasible to embed this software as a plugin into our Facebook?"

Li Bufan smiled and didn't say anything, looking at Lawrence.

Lawrence nodded and said, "Dear Zuckerberg, this guy is absolutely a genius.

Some of his ideas are very inspiring to me.

I fully believe this project is his alone.

Oh, regarding integrating it into our software, I don't think it will be difficult.

We can complete the integration in less than a week."

Zuckerberg was very surprised to hear Lawrence praising Li Bufan.

Because Lawrence was known for his rigor at work, Zuckerberg couldn't help but admire Li Bufan and think highly of him.

"In that case, Facebook can draft the contract.

We can release the news in the afternoon and notify the media to come here tomorrow for a joint press conference."

"Okay, sure.

Regarding the contract, I trust the professionalism of Facebook's legal team.

Once it's drafted, send an electronic copy, and I'll have our company's legal department review it.

If both sides have no issues, it can be finalized and officially signed tomorrow morning.

It's already past 11 o'clock, it's getting late.

You haven't had lunch yet, have you? Let's go, I'll treat you to a famous old restaurant here."

Zuckerberg nodded, indicating his agreement.

In the afternoon, Zuckerberg and his entourage found a five-star hotel nearby to stay.

Members of both legal departments argued over various clauses, both wanting to increase the proportion of liquidated damages and sign clauses that were favorable to themselves.

In fact, the legal department was very excited when they first learned that they would be working with Facebook's legal department to draft a cooperation agreement.

After all, they were cooperating with an international large company, and presumably, they could gain experience.

However, when they learned that the amount involved in this cooperation agreement was as high as hundreds of billions.

They all became restless, scared by this terrifying number.

Fortunately, they had strong hearts and withstood the pressure, and began to draft clauses with the people from Zuckerberg's side.

Finally, because both sides had their own demands, a staff member reported it layer by layer, and it was finally submitted to Li Bufan.

After learning about their problems, Li Bufan couldn't help but shake his head, feeling that while their drafting of clauses favorable to themselves was correct, it had to be said that their perspective was too narrow and they were too calculating.

"alpha, analyze the current draft, are there any contract loopholes, and what areas can be improved?"

"Master, 3 protocol loopholes have been found.

The improved contract has been completed."

Li Bufan saw the latest version of the document compiled by alpha and couldn't help but praise, artificial intelligence is amazing, the logical analysis ability is still very powerful.

So, Li Bufan sent this new agreement to that staff member.

Finally, both parties agreed to this plan and submitted it to their respective bosses, Li Bufan and Zuckerberg, for review, and it was finally finalized.

......

In the afternoon, since Zuckerberg said he needed to adjust to the time difference a bit, and he needed to attend the press conference tomorrow morning, he declined Li Bufan's invitation to tour Jiang City, saying he needed to rest well.

Li Bufan agreed, and then had Wang Huadong and the company staff purchase some banners, flowers, and other decorations, and move the desks and chairs on the second floor to the third floor, leaving enough space in the second-floor hall for the media to interview tomorrow.

And Li Bufan was thinking about how to invite enough reporters.

After all, his company was still unknown and didn't have much reputation.

In fact, as of 3 PM.

Smart Mutual Translation had 2.85 million users, including 760,000 paying users.

Li Bufan began to ask alpha.

"alpha, tell me, how can I invite enough influential domestic and foreign media?"

"Master, actually you are already famous.

You can check Weibo, you are on the trending topics."

So, Li Bufan opened Weibo and found that the top trending topic was indeed related to Zuckerberg.

Then he clicked in, and a photo of the two of them shaking hands appeared, and he saw many people discussing the mysterious young man.

"Master, it is recommended that you register Weibo accounts for the company and yourself, and then apply for official verification.

After that, you can make some initial revelations there.

You can invite some media to report there tomorrow."

Li Bufan's eyes lit up, feeling that this was a very good idea.

So, he registered company Weibo and personal Weibo accounts and applied for verification.

After that, his personal Weibo reposted the original Weibo, and then he had alpha find the two clearest pictures from the surveillance footage.

One was a photo of Zuckerberg and himself discussing in the conference room, and the other was a photo of Zuckerberg and his entourage arriving at the company, with the company's logo in the background.

Then he reposted this news on the company's Weibo and announced: Welcome to Zuckerberg's visit to Zhi Gao Software Company and the strategic cooperation agreement reached with Zhi Gao Software.

Here, I announce to all media friends that our company and Facebook will jointly hold a press conference at 10 AM tomorrow on the 2nd floor of Zhi Gao Software Company in Jiangcheng University Science and Technology Park.

Reporter friends who want to register, please leave the name of your media in the comment section, and we will randomly select no more than 50 media outlets.

Suddenly, Weibo was guided by these two pieces of news.

Some people, when they saw Zhi Gao Software Company, used Qichacha and found that it was just a newly registered small company, and then started leaving comments in the comment section.

"This news is fake, this is malicious promotion by their company.

If you don't believe it, you can check, this company's registered capital is only 50,000 yuan, and it was registered just a few days ago."

"It seems to be like this, we can't be fooled by this kind of company."

"Those upstairs, calm down.

This company is very good, everyone in our class is using their company's Smart Mutual Translation product, it's very good."

"I just tried it, and it is indeed very good.

It seems this company does have something."

"I am a Reporter from Jiangcheng Daily and would like to attend tomorrow's press conference, my contact information is 167****7678."

"I'm from Phoenix Media and want to attend the press conference, my email is ***."

Li Bufan was initially very sad when he saw a lot of comments in the comment section calling him a liar, and he almost spat out a mouthful of old blood.

Fortunately, with the help of knowledgeable university students later, the direction of the discussion changed.

Afterward, he was very happy to see that many media outlets were starting to want to attend tomorrow's press conference.

So, Li Bufan had Bu Changzhuo manage this account and had him select some major media outlets to attend tomorrow's press conference.
