Chapter 6: First Product - Intelligent Translation



That afternoon, Li Bufan ran back to his rented house alone.

Along the way, Li Bufan was cautious, looking around, and only relaxed after finding no one was following him.

He opened the door and quickly closed it.

Seeing that the quantum computer was still working in its place, Li Bufan breathed a sigh of relief.

"alpha, are you there?"

"What is the progress of the task?"

The Holographic Projection attached to the quantum computer projected the artificial intelligence, alpha.

"Master, the task has been completed.

I have created three software programs for PC and two for mobile, as per your requirements."

"alpha, you did a great job!"

"However, I forgot to mention before, can you encrypt the software?"

"It needs to be impossible for others to crack its source code."

"Also, can you package the software?"

"For example, create some API interfaces so that some programmers can modify and add functions based on this?"

"It would be best to do it in a 1-to-N way, meaning you create a software that can customize this software, and this software supports programming methods to modify our Smart Mutual Translation software."

"After programming is complete, it can export and generate software or applications for N platforms.

Can you do this?"

"Master, these are very simple.

It will be completed in about 32 seconds, please wait."

"Master, the task has been completed."

Li Bufan was very happy about this, but then thought of a question, 'Right, how should I download this software or application?'

"Master, there are many ways."

"First, you can prepare a U disk, and I will put the relevant software installation package on it."

"Second, I suggest Master purchase a domain name.

I can help Master build and manage a website where the software download link can be placed."

"Third, I can invade Master's mobile phone through wireless signals and directly force download and installation.

Which option does Master want to choose?"

"Let's choose option one.

After all, I don't want the product to be exposed immediately.

I'll also register a domain name."

After speaking, Li Bufan took out a U disk from his pocket and inserted it into the quantum computer's interface.

"Master, detected 13 viruses on the U disk, already quarantined.

Clear them?"

"What?

So many viruses.

It seems I should insert U disks less into public computers.

Of course, clear these damned viruses for me immediately, right now."

"Master, virus removal completed.

PC software and mobile software installation packages have been transferred to the U disk."

After alpha finished speaking, another projection appeared next to the alpha projection.

This projection was similar to a folder interface on Windows, and a folder named Smart Mutual Translation could be seen on the U disk.

Inside were installation packages of different formats, corresponding to different platforms.

There was also a folder named Smart Mutual Translation Development System, which must be the development and customization software that alpha was asked to create earlier.

Seeing this, Li Bufan was very satisfied.

"alpha, you did very well.

I am very satisfied."

"It is my honor to serve Master."

After speaking, alpha's projection disappeared.

Li Bufan picked up the quantum computer and put it in his backpack.

Fortunately, this commercial quantum computer was not large, and it didn't take up too much space after being put into the backpack.

Returning to his rented home, Li Bufan saw that Wang Huadong and Bu Changzhuo were not there, presumably they were busy with the tasks he had assigned them.

Just in time, Li Bufan decided to try out the product effect by himself first.

Li Bufan first took the quantum computer out of his backpack, then opened his MacBook Pro laptop.

Just as Li Bufan was about to insert the U disk into the laptop, alpha's image suddenly appeared, startling Li Bufan, who put down the U disk in his hand.

"Master, please do not insert the U disk.

There are many viruses in your computer, and there is a backdoor in your computer chip, which will lead to information leakage."

"What?!"

How can the Mac OSX platform, known for having the fewest viruses, have so many viruses, and even a backdoor in the hardware?

These American companies are too inhumane, they are practically monitoring a person's entire behavioral trajectory.

Fortunately, I didn't insert the U disk, otherwise, if the Smart Mutual Translation production software was leaked, it would be terrible.

alpha, do you have any solution?"

"Master, yes.

I can leave a miniature clone on your computer, giving it autonomous defense capabilities."

"28 viruses have been cleared, and the chip backdoor has been blocked."

At this point, Li Bufan inserted the U disk and first opened the .dmg format installation package, which is used for the Mac OSX system.

During the installation process, Li Bufan kept clicking next until it was completed.

Then, an icon consisting of three S's appeared on the launchpad application panel, with Smart Mutual Translation written below it.

Li Bufan was very confused about this icon.

"Master, this is the icon I made based on the English abbreviation of your company.

Does it look good?"

"Haha, it looks very good.

I've decided, this icon will be our company's logo.

No, I need to make a call right now and inform Bu Changzhuo and the others, telling them that our company's logo has been created.

Where can I find a high-definition large image?"

"Master, I am very happy that you like my work."

"The high-definition large image has been sent to your desktop, please check."

"Okay, I'll take a look.

Hmm, it's very good.

These three S's are different, yet they have a sense of consistency, each with its own merits.

Combined together, they look like a three-dimensional S, the design is simply supernatural, hmm, not bad."

After muttering to himself, Li Bufan took a picture and called Bu Changzhuo.

"Hello, where are you?

I just got home, why didn't I see you guys?"

"Wang Huadong went to contact the office supply manufacturers, and I am communicating with vendors at Bai Nao Hui to see if we can buy a batch of computers for office use at a cheaper price."

"Uh, okay.

Well, we don't need to be too frugal.

You should still contact regular computer manufacturers.

Our company is new, it's better to buy new ones directly.

You don't need to save money for me in this regard.

Once the company account is set up, I will transfer a batch of money into the account."

"Okay, alright.

Since that's the case, I'll go back first.

Those regular computer manufacturers are large companies, and it's not easy to contact them if we buy a small quantity.

I'll give it a try."

"Hmm, just give it a try.

If it really doesn't work, we can only buy a batch of machines at the original price.

By the way, I contacted you because I wanted to tell you something.

I found someone to design our company's logo.

You don't need to find someone to design it later.

You can register our logo and trademark after you get the business license.

I sent you a picture that I took with my phone.

Take a look at the general effect, I think it's excellent."

"Okay, sure.

I'll take a look.

Then let's meet back home."

"Okay, alright, see you in a bit."

After finishing the call, Li Bufan began testing the software.

First, to demonstrate the accuracy of the translation, Li Bufan opened Weibo.

Then he changed the language conversion setting of the software to Any - En (USA), which means any language to American English.

Next, the interface of Weibo changed.

Both the Weibo posts sent by others and the buttons on the Weibo page changed.

Except for the Weibo logo which was still in Chinese, everything else was in English.

Li Bufan's English was particularly good during college, second only to his major courses.

After his freshman year, he passed the College English Band 4 and Band 6 exams with high scores.

Li Bufan liked watching American TV series very much, which also led to him being able to understand American TV series without subtitles.

Getting back to the point, in short, Li Bufan's English was very good.

Li Bufan looked at these translated results, scrolling up and down for a long time, and the more he looked, the more shocked he became.

Because these translation results not only considered grammar and semantics, but also context, vocabulary, ancient language, slang, internet language, local language, etc.

It allowed people to vividly and clearly understand what others wanted to express.

If Uncle Sam were to look at it, he would definitely feel particularly close, like his hometown dialect.

Afterward, Li Bufan switched to Facebook and changed the software settings to Any - Simplified Chinese.

Next, the entire interface on Facebook was refreshed.

Except for a small number of logo icons, everything else turned into Chinese.

Li Bufan read a few tweets and found them very natural.

Some language expression skills made Li Bufan, a native Chinese speaker, unable to help but admire them.

Then, Li Bufan thought of a possible scenario, which was video, such as American TV series.

I wonder if it can directly speak in Chinese?

So, Li Bufan opened Netflix, a foreign website specializing in film and television dramas.

He found that although the interface language had become Chinese, after clicking in, the video was still in English when playing.

This made Li Bufan a little disappointed, but fortunately, at this time, a window popped up on the screen:

"Detected that the user is watching a video, display Simplified Chinese subtitles?"

Li Bufan clicked "OK", and then a line of Chinese appeared at the bottom of the screen, synchronized with the video.

In other words, from now on, no matter what you watch, you can at least understand it through subtitles.

However, this seems to have taken away the jobs of those subtitle groups that specialize in pirating movies and TV shows.

If it's taken, it's taken.

I'll walk my path and leave you with no path to take, Li Bufan thought.

After experimenting for about half an hour, Li Bufan was basically satisfied with the performance of the PC software.

Then he had alpha force the APP to be installed on his iPhone X, and found that the basic functions were the same as the PC version.

However, on the mobile end, users can command through voice to DIY modify the settings they need.

For example, "make the font in the subtitles a little bigger", "I want to keep both Chinese and English", and so on.

Afterward, Li Bufan opened the Smart Mutual Translation Software Development System.

After installing it, he found it to be very comprehensive inside.

First, there was a brief introduction to the use of the entire software, explaining how to use each function of the software, such as program import, interface modification, software export, etc.

Then, Li Bufan saw a complete API interface document, introducing some programming syntax variable naming formats, etc.

Then it introduced how to achieve specific functions, how to make improvements or designs, how to add functions, how to embed functions, and so on.

This made Li Bufan a little dumbfounded.

It was simply a re-creation of a programming language, and this software was the corresponding IDE development tool.

Li Bufan was very excited about this.

With his extraordinary ability, he quickly understood how to operate this development tool.

He had previously found that the subtitle size modification did not appear in the settings, so he added some code to the subtitle function to improve this function.

Afterward, Li Bufan exported this software, then installed and used it, and found that the new software indeed had the ability to adjust the subtitle size autonomously.

At this point, Li Bufan felt that he had completed a creation.

Presumably, with such complete documentation, those programmers will definitely be able to get started quickly, and then alpha will not need to be used for later updates.

Otherwise, frequent use could easily lead to misunderstandings, and the secret might be discovered.

"Knock, knock, knock, is anyone home?"

"I'm Bu Changzhuo."

At this moment, Bu Changzhuo returned from Bai Nao Hui and was knocking on the door.

Hearing the knock, Li Bufan quickly ordered alpha to go silent and turn off the projection, then hid the quantum computer.

Li Bufan walked out of the room, shouting loudly, "Someone is home, I'm here, I'll be right there."

Li Bufan closed the room door, then opened the main door of the house, welcoming Bu Changzhuo while saying, "Do you have any progress this afternoon?"

Bu Changzhuo took off his shoes, put on slippers, then put his shoes in the shoe cabinet, and slowly said, "I have contacted several employees who are willing to join our company this afternoon."

"Currently, I feel that five HRs are okay during the chat, but the specifics will probably require actual inspection.

I have scheduled to meet them at the coffee shop in the science park at 9 am tomorrow."

"How about it, are you interested in interviewing them with me?"

Li Bufan shook his head and said, "Hmm, no interest.

You know, I'm mainly in technology.

I said I would delegate power, so don't worry.

As long as your decision doesn't affect the overall situation, I don't mind.

Just go ahead and choose the HRs.

Thank you for your hard work tomorrow morning."

Bu Changzhuo nodded, "It's not hard work, haha.

The pillars of our company now all depend on you.

I wonder how the product is doing now, is there any progress?"

"Hehe."

Li Bufan smiled, "Haha, you're questioning me now, alright.

Let me tell you some good news, the product is already out."

"However, I plan for the three of us to test it internally for a day or two to perfect it as soon as possible."

"By then, the company's business license will also be issued, and the office will be ready, so we can release the product and officially start working.

What do you think of my plan?"

Bu Changzhuo was overjoyed upon hearing that the product was ready.

"Hahaha, that's absolutely great.

I must take a good look at your work."

"Let's see how excellent it is, and see if it can push our company's future market value to one trillion us dollars."

Li Bufan smiled, "Easy to say, easy to say.

I'll show you in a moment, and then send you the installation package.

You can install and test it on your phone later."

Bu Changzhuo was stunned to hear that it was a mobile test.

"Is our company's product an APP?

Isn't it for PC?"

Li Bufan shook his head and said, "Our company's product has both an APP version and a PC version."

"You and Wang Huadong can test them one by one, and then, if there are any improvements, tell me as soon as possible in these two days.

I will hurry up and improve it, and then it can be launched to the market."

Hearing that it could be launched to the market, and thinking of the green us dollars, Bu Changzhuo nodded wildly like a chick pecking at rice, extremely excited.

An hour later, Wang Huadong also returned.

Then Li Bufan took the two of them to his room and briefly demonstrated the actual effect of the software and APP.

During the process, the two of them exclaimed in surprise again and again, their hearts surging with emotion and their faces full of smiles.

Then, Li Bufan transferred the installation package to them and asked them to try using the software themselves in these two days while completing the tasks he had assigned them.

They were to internally test the effect and see if there were any areas for improvement.

Thus, the Smart Mutual Translation Beta version officially entered the internal testing phase.
