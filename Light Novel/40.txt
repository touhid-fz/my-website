Chapter 40 Overseas Recruitment



A few days later, the business license for Cosmos Security (China) Company in Jiang City was also approved.

Mr. Li Bufan started leaving messages on Weibo.

“Hello everyone, long time no see. I'm back again. That's right, I have recovered and officially taken over the position of CEO of Zhi Gao Software.

Next, I will lead Zhi Gao Software to rapid development, go international, and become the pinnacle of software companies. In this process, there will definitely be many obstacles and monsters.

However, we are not afraid. For this reason, I have specially established Cosmos Security (China) Company and will recruit excellent talents in China.

Among them, security personnel are divided into two treatment levels.

The first level of treatment does not require overseas special training, and you can enjoy a monthly salary of 10,000 to 30,000 yuan in China.

The second level of treatment does not open recruitment channels in China. These are personnel hired in China from the head office located in the Cayman Islands, specifically to protect the company's senior management, with salaries ranging from 50,000 to 1,000,000 yuan per month.

Note: The recruitment for the head office only recruits overseas personnel, not domestic personnel. This is because the head office requires special training, which may involve life-threatening risks.

And China obviously does not allow this type of company recruitment, so Li Bufan plans to recruit mostly overseas Chinese, supplemented by some other excellent overseas talents.

For these people, a contract acknowledging self-responsibility for life and death is required. If they die, a one-time compensation of 5 million yuan will be paid. If they live, the salary will range from 50,000 to 1 million yuan per month. The relevant life and death contract will be signed between Cosmos Security Company, the head office located in the Cayman Islands, and the individual.

Overseas veterans, security guards who don't want to be ordinary security guards, and insightful people who want to experience an exciting life are welcome to submit their resumes to the email hr@hybq.com.”

The company's Weibo account subsequently reposted this message from Mr. Li Bufan, and Mr. Li Bufan added a small easter egg at the end.

“The company's new product will be released in one week. Reporters are welcome to attend.”

To put it bluntly, this new product is the tool Mr. Li Bufan uses to monitor the world, which is alpha's infinitely many low-level avatars - Artificial Intelligence Assistants.

They will act as ears and eyes, constantly monitoring any actions targeting Mr. Li Bufan and his company, friends, and family.

......

Online, everyone was “shocked” by Mr. Li Bufan's sudden recovery. They left comments under Mr. Li Bufan's Weibo, asking how he suddenly got better.

Mr. Li Bufan thought for a moment, pinned the comment asking the question, and then replied.

“Thank you all for your concern. The reason for my recovery is thanks to the help of countless medical staff at Jiang City Hospital.

To show my gratitude, I plan to donate 50 million yuan to Jiang City Hospital to help poor patients who need money for surgery.”

Then many people expressed disbelief, and Jiang City Hospital was @ed.

Jiang City Hospital's response was more ambiguous.

“First of all, saving lives and helping the injured is the duty of doctors and nurses.

Secondly, we thank Mr. Li Bufan for his donation. We will use this money to help families in need and help them get rid of the pain of illness.

Regarding this application, everyone can call for consultation later.”

However, netizens did not buy it and felt it was perfunctory.

“I guess, did Jiang City Hospital use some extremely expensive special medicine?”

“Could it be some traditional Chinese medicine? The legendary divine medicine that can bring the dead back to life and heal bones?”

“The person upstairs is thinking too much. How could there be such a thing? Why couldn't it be some high-tech equipment, rapid hemostasis, automatic organ replacement?”

“You guys, could it be that Mr. Li Bufan is not a Human from Blue Star? But some alien creature?”

“The person upstairs has a rich imagination, and mentally challenged children have more fun. Identification complete.”

“Could it be genetic medicine developed by Zhi Gao Software's secret research and development department?”

“You said it's Zhi Gao Software, how could it involve other fields? They seem to be only strong in software, and have nothing else.”

“Then what is the new product release that Zhi Gao Software mentioned? Is it still software?”

“It should be, right? It's impossible to be some genetic medicine.”

“Unclear but awesome, anyway, it feels very unbelievable.”

“+ 1”

......

Subsequently, the topic of Mr. Li Bufan's recovery could not be dug deeper, and everyone shifted to recruitment.

Only then did they realize that the biggest news was here.

Seeing the high salaries, everyone was eager to sign up.

Some people not only signed up themselves but also forwarded it to their relatives and friends, inviting everyone to become high-class security guards together.

Thus, #HighSalaryRecruitingSecurityGuards# Cosmos Security began to trend.

In fact, most people were surprised by the second type of treatment, after all, it was too generous.

However, there was a possibility of death, and Mr. Li Bufan only recruited overseas personnel, so many people were helpless and had to choose the first type of treatment.

On overseas social platforms, many foreigners and overseas Chinese were very interested and asked to join the head office, inquiring about what kind of training would lead to life-threatening risks.

At this time, the two accounts registered by Mr. Li Bufan, one for Cosmos Security Head Office and the other for the China Branch, were both officially verified with a V by Weibo.

Then, Mr. Li Bufan pinned the comment asking the question and @ed the Weibo accounts of the two companies.

And these two company accounts issued announcements.

First, Cosmos Security Head Office.

“Dear friends, friends from all over the world. We are Cosmos Security Company, headquartered in the Cayman Islands.

Our company's business is:

1. Accepting employment from some countries or forces, our employees will participate in the battlefield as mercenaries.

2. Receiving requests from the China Branch and dispatching security personnel back to China to serve as bodyguards for the company's senior management.

We will purchase a batch of the most excellent firearms from the international market. At that time, international arms dealers are welcome to come for negotiations.

For our employees at the head office, we will equip them with equipment and weapons no less than those of United States soldiers to maximize the safety of our employees' lives.

Our personnel must first undergo two months of closed military training.

Personnel who pass the training will stay. Either they can return to the China Branch to be among the highest-paid security guards in the first-class treatment, with a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan.

Or they can continue to stay in our company, with a minimum monthly salary of 50,000 yuan. After that, they will participate in combat as mercenaries and will receive additional subsidies and allowances based on their military achievements.

The older the seniority and the more military achievements, the higher the subsequent salary.

If they choose to retire from the front line, they can return to the China Branch and serve as security personnel with the second-class treatment. They can retain their current salary, but it will not continue to increase.”

Next, Cosmos Security (China) Company also issued a statement.

“Hello everyone, we are the China branch of Cosmos Security.

The purpose of this company is to provide security for Cosmos system companies, Zhi Gao Software, and Mr. Li Bufan's family and friends.

Regarding the first-class treatment, it's not that anyone can get it. Training is also required. If you pass, you can receive the corresponding salary. If you fail, you will be compensated for lost work time.

Regarding the second-class treatment, it is not set by us, but by the head office.

Those who want to apply for the second-class treatment are actually signing an employment contract with the head office. They will be sent to the head office's location to receive closed military training.

During this process, the head office will decide whether to keep them or not based on their performance.

If you want to continue to join the head office and enjoy a high salary, you will sign a series of contracts with the head office.”

On the internet, everyone left comments.

“This Mr. Li Bufan is too awesome. He's actually like the Blackwater Company in the United States. I admire him.”

“Is this mercenary thing not allowed in our country?”

“It's not allowed, but it is allowed abroad.”

“So, I can go to the battlefield then. I wonder how many enemies my 8x scope and big sniper will kill? I'm really looking forward to it.”

“The person upstairs, that's a real battlefield, aren't you afraid of sacrificing yourself? And he only recruits overseas talents.”

“What's there to be afraid of? You can get 5 million even if you sacrifice yourself. Can you earn that much money in your entire life?”

“Hehe, to put it bluntly, I think Mr. Li Bufan is afraid of death.”

“Mr. Li Bufan, he's like someone who has been bitten by a snake and is afraid of well ropes for ten years. He almost died before, so of course he has to be careful now.”

......

After learning about this, the relevant departments in Jiang City were neither disgusted nor in favor of Mr. Li Bufan's approach.

The call quickly reached Mr. Li Bufan's mobile phone.

“Hello, are you Mr. Li Bufan?”

“Yes, who is this?”

“Hello, I am the secretary of the Deputy Mayor of Jiang City. He wants me to ask you. Why did you post this message online? This will make many people take risks. Do you know how many families will be broken up because of this?”

“Well, I know. That's why I only recruit overseas personnel and it doesn't affect China. Besides this, is there anything else?”

“Uh, we just wanted to ask, don't you trust our personnel?”

“That's not it. I am very confident in China, but can you serve me 24 hours a day without stopping? This is obviously impossible.

You know, if it wasn't for the last few bodyguards who sacrificed themselves last time, I might not even be breathing fresh air on Blue Star right now. So, bodyguards are very important.”

“Well, yes, you are right.”

“Oh, by the way, since you called me. It's perfect, I also wanted to ask, I wonder if our security company can be equipped with guns in China?”

“Uh, that is not allowed.”

“Okay, then what about just my bodyguard or myself?”

“I'm sorry, Mr. Li. According to relevant laws and regulations, ordinary citizens cannot apply for a gun license and cannot legally carry firearms.”

“Is that so? Okay, I was just asking casually. I will abide by the laws and regulations. Alright then, that's all, bye.”

“Mr. Li, wait, I haven't asked you yet, what is the new product launch your company mentioned? Uh, he actually hung up.”

......

Mr. Li Bufan instructed alpha to organize the resumes collected so far, then search for their real information and compare it. After a series of screenings, the first batch of 50 employees for the first category, i.e., employees who will stay in China, will be selected.

Also, 100 overseas employees for the second-class treatment have been screened, but the training base headquarters located overseas has not yet been built and still needs to wait.
