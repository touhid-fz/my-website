Chapter 24 Meeting with Internet tycoons, reverse acquisition



After Li Bufan's conversation with Bu Changzhuo, he learned how to effectively negotiate with Tencent Group regarding the acquisition of Tian Tian Reading.

However, the person who facilitated this connection had to be Li Bufan himself.

To this end, Li Bufan first searched the Tencent Group official website for ways to make an appointment with Ma Dage, but the result was obvious: there was no mention of it.

It only stated, "For business cooperation, please contact xx," which clearly indicated that this level of cooperation was, at most, general cooperation and it would be difficult to convey the message to the highest level.

Helpless, Li Bufan had no choice but to request alpha's assistance.

"alpha, help me find Ma Dage's private phone number."

"As you command, Master. After searching, I found he has 4 mobile phone numbers.

One is specifically for contacting family, one is for close friends and partners, one is for ordinary friends and general partners, and the last one is his phone number abroad.

After verification, only the first two phone numbers are currently turned on."

"Is that so? Alright then, the second mobile phone number will do."

"As you command, Master. The phone number is 178****8888. Should I dial now?"

"Wow, so many 8s, as expected of an internet tycoon, truly impressive! Yes, okay, alpha, dial it now."

......

At this moment, it was the afternoon, and Ma Dage, as usual, returned home early from the company, spending time with his family, feeling very satisfied watching their happy and joyful expressions.

At this time, his phone suddenly rang, causing Ma Dage to frown.

Because he had told his good friends or close partners who had this phone number that they could call this number in the morning when he was at the company and could handle official business.

If it was any other time, they should try not to call, unless it was for personal matters unrelated to work, such as inviting him to dinner or going out to play.

When Ma Dage opened his phone, he found an unknown number originating from Jiang City.

This made Ma Dage very confused, as he didn't know anyone in Jiang City who could get his phone number.

He thought of advertisements, but shook his head; their company specialized in internet products.

The latest technology and all useful functions for things like mobile phone security Steward were always first implemented on the phones of senior executives.

Therefore, logically, such advertisements should be identified and blocked.

Could it be that someone called by mistake?

He couldn't be sure, but he thought that if that were truly the case, he would just have to change his number later. After all, he didn't want to be bothered all day.

Helplessly, out of curiosity as to who it was, Ma Dage finally answered the call.

"Hello, who is this? How did you get my phone number?"

This immediately made Li Bufan a little awkward; he really didn't know how to start, as what he did was indeed a bit impolite.

Li Bufan could tell that his call seemed to have disturbed his good mood.

For this, Li Bufan was very apologetic, but he had no choice but to thicken his skin and speak.

"Ahem... I am Li Bufan, the Chairman of Zhi Gao Software.

Hello, Ma Dage, it's a pleasure to hear your voice. I grew up listening to your stories and playing your games.

Ahem... Actually, I'm looking for you mainly because I have something I'd like to discuss with you regarding strengthening cooperation between our two companies.

As for the phone number, haha, who doesn't have some connections, right, you say?

How about it, do you want to hear about the cooperation?"

"Okay, Mr. Li, hello, I am Ma Huateng.

Since you have something to discuss, please speak directly, after all, I don't want to deal with work matters during my leisure time."

"Okay, alright, Ma Dage.

I want to ask you one question: Do you want your company's social platform—Micro-Speech—to gain the Smart Mutual Translation function?"

"Hmm? Really? I remember sending someone to contact you before, and didn't you refuse?

Now you've come to find me, are you here to mock me? Or are you playing with me?"

"Uh, I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare. How could I be presumptuous in front of a senior?

I sincerely want to cooperate with your esteemed company. After all, we are all Chinese, and it's good to help if we can, right?

How about we meet in person to discuss the specific cooperation method in detail? When do you think you'll be free?"

"Okay, since that's the case, then you come to our company headquarters tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, and I'll wait for you in my office.

I'll inform my secretary shortly to prepare your access pass in advance, otherwise you won't be able to enter."

"Okay! Then I'll see you tomorrow morning, and I wish us a pleasant cooperation in advance!"

"Okay, alright, see you tomorrow."

......

Li Bufan was very happy to see that Ma Dage had the intention of cooperating with him.

He then called Wang Huadong, the head of the secretarial department, and asked him to make arrangements, book a plane ticket to Shenzhen that would arrive before 9 AM tomorrow, and arrange for bodyguards to accompany him and other related matters.

Soon, Wang Huadong handled everything; the plane ticket was for 6:55 AM tomorrow, arriving in Shenzhen at 8:38 AM. Two secretaries and two bodyguards would accompany him.

......

Early the next morning, Li Bufan woke up very early, arrived at the airport under the escort of bodyguards, and boarded the first-class cabin.

Finally, they arrived in Shenzhen on time.

Along the way, Li Bufan was not in the mood to look at the scenery from the air, although the view from high altitude looking down was beautiful and unique.

But Li Bufan was thinking about how to reach a secret cooperation agreement with Ma Dage.

In the end, Li Bufan didn't come up with any good ideas, and looking at the natural scenery outside the window, he decided to just let nature take its course.

The next day, Li Bufan arrived at the entrance of the Tencent Group headquarters and was stopped by the security guard at the door.

The security guard saw that Li Bufan was accompanied by two female secretaries and two male bodyguards and knew that he was an important person.

It was highly likely that he had a meeting to discuss with the company's senior executives, so the security guard dared not offend him and could only ask Li Bufan and his group to wait outside the door for someone to pick him up.

Seeing this, Li Bufan remembered the access pass he had received via text message and showed it to the security guard.

The security guard nodded upon seeing it.

"Sir, since you have a temporary access pass, you may enter the headquarters building.

Those accompanying you cannot enter as they do not have access passes.

I suggest you can ask them to wait in the nearby leisure area, which is also accessible to visitors."

Li Bufan thought for a moment and felt there was no major issue, so he asked them to wait outside for him.

Li Bufan was not worried about encountering any mishaps, after all, he was at the company headquarters.

The person who should be most worried about encountering danger should not be Li Bufan, but others.

Because once some malicious incident occurred, it would greatly impact their company negatively.

So, Li Bufan just walked in grandly like that.

After entering the elevator, Li Bufan pressed the top floor, but the elevator made a sound at this moment.

"Ding, the floor you selected is an important floor. Please swipe your card to identify yourself, otherwise you do not have permission to enter."

Li Bufan was startled, not expecting such an operation in the elevator. He found it quite interesting and thought he could try it in his own company's headquarters building in the future.

Li Bufan didn't hesitate and placed the QR code information received in the text message onto the elevator camera for scanning.

"Ding, permission granted. Temporary access pass, Li Bufan, welcome. Remaining validity: 11 hours 46 minutes."

Then the elevator door slowly closed, and the elevator began to ascend, accelerating at first, then maintaining a constant speed for a while, and finally slowing to a stop.

The entire process took 1 minute and 39 seconds, which was relatively fast for a building close to 50 floors.

Next, Li Bufan looked at the signs on the indicator board and found the Chairman's office.

Li Bufan took a deep breath and then knocked on the door.

"Please come in."

Li Bufan slowly pushed open the door and saw an incredibly spacious and bright hall, where a middle-aged man was sitting, looking at Li Bufan with a playful expression.

"I presume this is the Chairman of Zhi Gao Software, Li Bufan, Mr. Li? It's a pleasure to finally meet you."

Li Bufan didn't expect Ma Dage to immediately give him a 'flattery kill' to put him in his place. He couldn't help but smile and replied to Ma Dage.

"Haha, I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare.

As a junior, I still have much to learn from you, senior.

I have been using your company's products since I was young.

You are my role model, a pioneer of the era, and one of the key figures in China's great rejuvenation."

Ma Dage saw that Li Bufan reacted so quickly, couldn't help but look at him in a new light, and then nodded.

He pointed to the chair on his right side, indicating for him to sit down, and then began to ask.

"A distinguished guest has arrived, but I don't have any expensive tea here. Would you like tea or water?"

"Uh, I'll have tea."

"Haha, as expected, quite clever. Xiao Wang, brew a cup of Wuyi Mountain Mother Tree Da Hong Pao for this young Brother."

"Okay, Ma Zong."

Li Bufan couldn't help but secretly click his tongue. He said he didn't have any expensive tea, but indeed, no tea could be more precious than the tea brewed from the Wuyi Mountain Mother Tree Da Hong Pao.

You should know that its yield is extremely small, only a few catties a year, and it is usually auctioned by the gram. One catty costs almost ten million us dollars.

Li Bufan sat in the seat designated by Ma Dage and said with a smile.

"Ma Dage, you are too kind.

We haven't even discussed business yet, and you've already invited me to drink such precious tea. This really makes me feel flattered."

Ma Dage looked at Li Bufan and secretly praised him as a good negotiator.

Generally, in business negotiations, whoever speaks first will be fiercely bitten by the other party.

This is not about seizing the initiative, but about planning before acting.

"Haha, Mr. Li, you don't have to be so polite.

How much money is this? Our group's annual profit may not even be comparable to your company's weekly profit."

Li Bufan was speechless, but it was also true.

Although Tencent Group's annual revenue is hundreds of billions, the actual profit margin will not be too high. It would be very good to earn over a hundred billion in the end.

As for Li Bufan's Zhi Gao Software, it earned over a hundred billion in cash in one week, making countless companies in China envious.

Fortunately, Li Bufan later donated half, which made many companies give up the idea of going against Zhi Gao Software.

"Ma Dage, your group is a true internet giant, the leader among Chinese enterprises, and you are even the richest man in China.

Your company can earn hundreds of billions in profit every year, which can flow like a steady stream, like the ocean, never drying up.

And our company is just a small-time parvenu. Compared to your group, it's not even worth mentioning. It's simply comparing a minor sorcerer to a great wizard."

"Haha, allow me to call you Li, if that's alright?"

"Hmm, completely fine."

"Li, although you see our group's strong profitability.

But do you know how many employees our group has? Hundreds of thousands worldwide!

And you don't even have one percent of our employees, yet you can earn such astonishing wealth.

Furthermore, I heard that you are about to launch a groundbreaking special effects software that will lead the industry standard?"

"Well, our company's second product - Aurora Special Effects is about to go online. It is indeed excellent, but it can't be considered leading the industry standard, haha."

"Li, you are too modest.

I have also seen the videos made by your company, and indeed, they are very good.

As you know, our group also has a film and television company under its umbrella, and for this, I specifically called the relevant person in charge to inquire.

The result was that they said your technology is definitely the best in the industry.

If you don't admit it, then it's estimated that no company would dare to claim their special effects software is ranked second."

"Haha, perhaps it's a coincidence."

"Coincidence? I don't think so. Do you know?

Some people say that you are the Bill Gates of China, and within the next ten years, you will definitely become the richest man in China.

This prediction has surprised us older generation greatly.

At first, I didn't dare to believe it, but today I see you are so young, only in your 20s, and you have built such a large family business.

The future is promising! The future will be your era."

"Senior is joking.

Who knows what the future holds? I only know that now, you and the seniors are the leaders and pioneers in various industries, worthy of our learning and admiration."

Ma Dage saw that Li Bufan was so impervious and chatted with him about business for half an hour.

He hadn't seen him start discussing cooperation matters and was a little impatient.

So, he directly opened his mouth to inquire.

"Alright, let's not talk nonsense anymore.

Since you are here for cooperation, then, can you tell me what you mean by your so-called cooperation?"

Li Bufan finally saw Ma Dage start to ask, and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

Because he had been facing Ma Dage's questions before, and had to carefully consider every sentence, which was very brain-racking.

"Ma Dage, I want to acquire Tian Tian Reading, a company under your group."

Ma Dage was very angry when he heard Li Bufan say he wanted to acquire a company under his group.

Because usually, he was the one acquiring other people's companies. When did someone ever acquire his company in reverse?

So he looked at Li Bufan with an unfriendly gaze and said in a deep voice.

"Impossible. Tian Tian Reading is an important piece in our closed-loop layout, and we will not give it up.

Since you have no intention of cooperating, then please..."

Seeing Ma Dage about to send him away, Li Bufan quickly interrupted him and said.

"No, please let me finish. Give me one minute."

Ma Dage nodded and motioned for Li Bufan to continue speaking.

"Nothing is non-negotiable. If there is, it's just that the benefits are not enough.

I am willing to allow your company's product, Micro-Speech, to use the Smart Mutual Translation plugin as an exchange, allowing me to acquire Tian Tian Reading.

I think this benefit is enough, right?

You should know that Facebook paid us 20 billion us dollars, but they are now becoming increasingly active in the international market, their voice is getting heavier and heavier, and their market value has risen by more than 100 billion us dollars compared to before using our company's plugin.

From this, it can be seen that if your company's Micro-Speech also has our Smart Mutual Translation function, I think the problem you have always had with promoting in the overseas market can be much easier.

This is equivalent to a stepping stone for your company's products to go international. I think this benefit is already enough to make you tempted to give up Tian Tian Reading, right?"

Ma Dage pondered for a long time and nodded secretly.

"That's right, you are very correct. Nothing is non-negotiable.

Before, the benefits were not enough, but with Smart Mutual Translation, indeed, the benefits are large enough.

However, didn't you sign a strategic cooperation agreement with Facebook, which stated exclusive usage rights?"

"Haha, that's right.

It says that Zhi Gao Software's Smart Mutual Translation has reached an exclusive cooperation agreement with Facebook.

So what if it's not our company's translation product?

What if I say that our company's firewall was once hacked due to insufficient protection, and the development tools for the Smart Mutual Translation software were obtained and then sold to a company registered in the Cayman Islands.

Do you believe this?"

Ma Dage looked at Li Bufan with an incredulous expression, secretly surprised by Li Bufan's boldness, and also felt a trace of vigilance.

However, benefits are tempting, and this is beneficial to his own company's product, Micro-Speech, without any harm.

So he smiled knowingly, with an expression of "I understand", looked at Li Bufan, and nodded.

"Haha, that's right, I believe it.

Since that's the case, then there's no problem.

However, I don't know, besides agreeing to your request to acquire Tian Tian Reading, is there anything else that needs to be paid to get Smart Mutual Translation?"

"Haha, the specific matters are not something our company can know.

After all, this is data stolen by hackers and now belongs to other companies. Our company has no right to interfere with their actions.

But please rest assured on one point, that company informed us that the transaction will be completed at a price of less than 10 billion us dollars.

And we want to acquire your company's Tian Tian Reading, with a 10% premium, which will require at least 18.9 billion us dollars.

In other words, after giving up Tian Tian Reading, you will earn at least 8.9 billion us dollars, plus a Smart Mutual Translation plugin.

This transaction is very fair, isn't it?"

Ma Dage smiled, nodded, extended his hand, and shook hands with Li Bufan.

"Haha, Li. You are very right, I can represent the Board of Directors and agree to this matter.

So when do we start the transaction? I can't wait, haha."

"Ma Dage, I need to contact the other company about this. How about completing the transaction within three days?"

"Hmm, no problem. Then I wish us a pleasant cooperation!"

"Haha, pleasant cooperation!"

"Li, since we are having such a pleasant chat, do you want to stay and have a drink with Brother at noon?"

"Cough cough... No need. My bodyguards and secretary are still waiting outside the company.

Although they are employees, keeping them waiting for a long time, as the Boss, I feel bad.

How about I treat Ma Dage to a drink after the cooperation is completed?"

"Haha, I can't tell, Li is quite a sentimental person. Alright, we'll talk about it then."

"Okay, I'll take my leave first."

"Okay, I'll also call a Board of Directors meeting to explain the situation. Take care, I won't see you out."

"Okay, no problem, I know the way."

Li Bufan returned to the company in the afternoon.

Because he was facing the internet giants of China, along the way, he went from being anxious to being natural, and then to being comfortable, even leading the rhythm.

His psychological journey was arduous and bumpy, but fortunately, everything went smoothly.

Just like that, Li Bufan completed an important negotiation.

As for other matters, he left them to Bu Changzhuo, the company CEO who specialized in running errands for him.
