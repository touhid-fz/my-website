Chapter 28 Project Adam



After the Zhi Gao Software press conference, several tech giants in Silicon Valley all felt threatened.

They had heard about the Facebook incident before, treating it as after-dinner conversation, mocking Zuckerberg and thinking he had lost face for them as capitalists by being swindled out of 20 billion us dollar by a China kid.

At the time, they didn't think too much about it, just assuming it was an isolated incident unrelated to them.

However, now, less than a month later, Zhi Gao Software has released a new product again.

Although it is in the niche industry of special effects production, the Artificial Intelligence Assistant used within it sent shivers down the spine of everyone who watched the video.

Because they knew very well that their own companies were currently far from being able to achieve this.

Furthermore, seeing the Zhi Gao Software CEO's relaxed and comfortable expression at the press conference, it seemed they would expand into more fields and industries in the future.

At that time, it would inevitably intersect with their main businesses, and by then, it would be too late to regret.

Therefore, they felt a very strong sense of crisis.

As a result, several of the big shots called each other and put their heads together.

Well then, they decided to directly unite the high-tech companies in Silicon Valley and start a secret summit.

Thus, there were over 50 companies present, each a leader in their industry or possessing innovative technology patents.

Google, as the leader of this secret summit, had its president seated at the head, beginning discussions with everyone.

"Everyone, the purpose of our gathering here today is very clear and simple.

That's right, we all have a sense of crisis, a deep sense of crisis that we feel from China's Zhi Gao Software.

Friends, it's quite ridiculous, isn't it?

I think not long ago, perhaps China's state-owned enterprises were holding similar meetings, trying every means to unite and break through our technological blockade against China.

But now, the situation seems to have reversed, leading to the emergence of Zhi Gao Software Company.

We need to unite to develop Artificial Intelligence, striving to release a true Artificial Intelligence before Zhi Gao Software does.

This is indeed frustrating, but also very realistic.

If they truly succeed, I believe that even if those present here are not excluded from cooperation by that company, they will inevitably be hit by their patent club, losing most of our core interests.

This is like how we are currently bleeding China's enterprises dry in high-tech fields such as communication and chips.

They have the most employees but earn the least money, while the lion's share is entirely in the hands of the companies present here.

This feeling, for us, is very satisfying, and we consider it natural.

But for them, perhaps they are already used to it. But what if, and I mean *if*, it were reversed, and we had to pay them a large patent fee, would you be willing?

I certainly would not be willing under any circumstances, because for us, being at the top of the pyramid, that would be too humiliating."

"That's right, we must unite. We cannot let Zhi Gao Software break through our technological blockade one by one anymore.

We don't want to encounter the Facebook incident again; it was truly too humiliating, practically selling out for glory."

"Ahem... Zuckerberg is here. It's better to keep some things clear in your own mind; there's no need to state them openly to his face. Heh heh."

And at this moment, Zuckerberg's face was as uncomfortable as if it had been smeared with excrement, his complexion was ashen, but he also knew that what they said made sense and felt very helpless.

At this time, Apple CEO Cook, who was seated in the second position, raised a question.

"I agree that we should unite, but how will the results and profits obtained after uniting be distributed?

I suggest linking it to company market value; this is more in line with the current situation and won't cause too much market fluctuation. What do you all think?"

The people sitting below sneered inwardly, cursing his shamelessness, because calculated this way, no matter what, the biggest winner would be Apple Company.

"No, I don't agree. I think it should be distributed according to contribution."

"Yes, that's right. That's fair. The principle of distribution according to work is more reasonable."

Cook frowned slightly, then scoffed.

"Don't be ridiculous. Distribution according to work? Are you saying the more employees sent, the more profit is gained?"

"Well said, that's simply unrealistic."

The Google President, seated at the head, stopped everyone's argument.

"Alright, let's continue discussing the previous proposal to unite.

Currently, everyone's concern is the issue of uneven profit distribution.

Here, I have a suggestion.

We can distribute based on contribution weight. Each company will be assigned different tasks, or can proactively apply for tasks. Different tasks will have different contribution weights, and finally, the profits will be distributed according to the contribution weight each company obtains.

Among them, for those with outstanding contributions, they will be allowed to obtain higher contribution weights after approval from over 80% of the Board of Directors.

And those of us present here will join this special Board of Directors and have a seat.

I wonder, what do you all think about this?"

"I think your suggestion is excellent and very reasonable. However, what do you mean by the Board of Directors you mentioned?"

"Hmm, this Board of Directors refers to the management class of this Artificial Intelligence plan.

For the companies present here, each seat has one voting right.

Companies in the top ten by market value have two voting rights, and companies in the top three by market value have three voting rights and a veto power.

I wonder what you all think?"

"It's acceptable, but I disagree with your big companies having veto power; that's too unfair to the other companies."

"We are doing this to better ensure the interests of these enterprises and it is also a prerequisite for maintaining the entire Artificial Intelligence plan."

"Alright then, I can agree. But what about the funding issue?"

"Haha, funding is of course also a factor influencing contribution weight.

Of course, you can completely complete some Artificial Intelligence research in your own company and share the results with everyone to get contribution weight rewards."

"Hmm, that works."

"Very good, are there any other questions from everyone?

If not, everyone can return to their companies and discuss with the shareholders and investors behind them. Those who agree can come to Google headquarters later to sign the agreement."

"Okay, no problem, I can sign the agreement on behalf of our company right now."

"Haha, very good. What about the others present?"

In fact, this meeting was pushed forward by the financial groups behind the scenes; they were very clear about the importance of Artificial Intelligence.

And because of this, they told their investors to join this plan no matter what.

Because the financial groups behind the scenes would inject a colossal amount of hundreds of billions of us dollar into this unprecedented plan to accelerate the progress of Artificial Intelligence research.

Finally, all representatives signed on the spot, took a group photo, kept a copy of the contract, and took it back to their companies to give their investors an explanation.

And this meeting also established an Artificial Intelligence research plan with Google as the leading core, aptly named the "adam project".

......

Because this meeting was held silently at a secret estate, and some keywords like Artificial Intelligence, adam project, etc., were hidden in the contract.

It only said to conduct research together, but didn't specify what to research.

And everyone present knew clearly that this was to prevent spies from infiltrating through those slightly smaller companies and extracting relevant intelligence.

However, they still underestimated the investigative capabilities of various countries' intelligence Organizations.

After their repeated confirmation and analysis, they reached a conclusion.

The Silicon Valley companies united, aiming to develop Artificial Intelligence before Zhi Gao Software.

After receiving this thought-provoking news, it was sent overnight to the headquarters of various countries.

......

Russia.

A paper document was delivered into the hands of Emperor Pu of Russia.

After reading it, Emperor Pu of Russia was very angry, and also felt like laughing a little, but also a little sad.

Because, what angered him was that those financial groups were actually so ambitious as to want to develop true Artificial Intelligence, which couldn't help but make him feel a little creeped out.

He knew deeply that once the other side succeeded, all domestic internet infrastructure would be completely transparent to them.

They could very easily destroy a country's power, communication, economy, and order, sending a country back to the primitive age.

What made him want to laugh was that the intelligence about their plan called the "adam project" had already been obtained by Russia's intelligence personnel.

He could completely intensify the effort to gather intelligence and obtain more scientific research data.

At the same time, he would also order the Scientists to conduct more research.

What felt a little sad was that the reason they were doing this was not for the purpose of attack, but for self-preservation, to resist the threat from Zhi Gao Software.

How could Emperor Pu have imagined that in just a few decades, that great Eastern nation in the south, which had once fallen from grace, had risen silently.

And its technological development speed was astonishing, even giving birth to tech companies like Zhi Gao Software, which made their fortune with Artificial Intelligence technology.

However, he was also helpless about this. Fortunately, they were still considered partners for the time being, jointly resisting the threat from the West. This was the only good news.

......

Japan.

Abe, who was attending the Grand Sun Shrine, received a call from a staff member asking him to return to his residence to handle urgent intelligence.

Japan, this is a magical or perhaps a peculiar country.

From ancient times to the present, they have always worshipped the strong, possessing a fearless spirit unafraid of death, an unyielding craftsman's spirit, and furthermore, a servant's spirit of kneeling and begging for mercy.

Since World War 2, their economy began to recover with the help of the United States, and at one point, they surpassed the United States.

But this made the United States feel threatened by its little Brother, so it issued a series of unequal treaties such as the Plaza Accord.

And imposed certain sanctions, causing Japan's bubble economy to collapse and its economy to regress by decades.

This made people within Japan both love and hate the United States.

At this moment, the staff member handed the "adam project" data to Abe.

Abe began to read, and the more he read, the colder his heart became, and his face turned ugly.

Because if this plan succeeded, he understood that with the strength of those financial groups, Japan's high-tech field would soon be completely occupied by their results, namely Artificial Intelligence.

This would leave Japan with no chance of recovery, and from then on, whether economically or militarily, it would be controlled by the United States, becoming a complete and utter little Brother.

However, thinking of Japan's robotics industry which could rival Silicon Valley, his eyes lit up, and he thought that perhaps they could complete the research and development of Artificial Intelligence before them.

It was still uncertain who would emerge victorious at that time.

So he quickly ordered his subordinates to go down and prepare to establish the Japan Artificial Intelligence Research Institute and increase budget investment in the field of Artificial Intelligence in the future.

......

China, the relevant departments, upon receiving the news, immediately issued two directives:

First, immediately accelerate the pace of Artificial Intelligence research and achieve breakthrough progress in Artificial Intelligence as soon as possible.

Second, seek cooperation with Zhi Gao Software Company to conduct research and development together and share technology.

......

After this meeting ended, it was evident that the United States had many more companies claiming to be researching Artificial Intelligence.

At the same time, various countries also launched similar research.

Behind the scenes, intelligence personnel were very busy, and various countries were taking frequent actions.

While the general public continued as usual, living, working, studying, and being busy.

......

When Li Bufan learned about the "adam project" from alpha, he was quite dismissive, thinking, 'Even if I give you another ten years, you won't be able to research true "Artificial Intelligence".'

However, he also had to become vigilant and protect his own safety.

One obvious point was that the security measures for the villa became stricter, and he secretly ordered several security guards to be on duty 24 hours a day without interruption.

Li Bufan felt that since those Silicon Valley companies were so jumpy, he might as well give them a taste of their own medicine in the field of Artificial Intelligence in the future.

Let them understand who is the real Brother in the field of Artificial Intelligence!
