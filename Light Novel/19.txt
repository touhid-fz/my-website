Chapter 19 Conception of the Second Product



The next morning, Monday at 7 a.m., marked the beginning of another week.

Li Bufan and Liu Yuting were woken up by the alarm, opened their eyes, and saw each other holding one another.

They couldn't help but feel happy, smiles overflowing uncontrollably on their faces, feeling very content.

"Tingting, shall we get up now?"

"Yes, we should. We still have to go to work today, we can't be late."

"Okay, that's good. Then I'll wait for you after work at noon, and I'll take you to meet some of my good friends, how about that?"

"Oh, okay."

"Alright then, let's get up, wash up, and head out."

After arriving at the company, Li Bufan first dropped off Liu Yuting on her floor, and then left the company again.

This was because Li Bufan intended to move his belongings from the room he had previously rented with his two brothers to the newly purchased villa today.

Fortunately, as a man, he didn't have many things. After packing, he called a moving truck to deliver them to the villa.

After checking, most of the items were there, and no important things were lost.

Especially when the most valuable quantum computer was still there, Li Bufan breathed a sigh of relief.

After that, he simply tidied up and sorted and placed the items.

"alpha, are you there?"

alpha's image was projected from the quantum computer's accessories. The holographic projection of alpha rubbed its eyes, as if it had just woken up.

"Yes, Master, do you have any instructions?"

"Yes, there are a few things.

First, check and monitor the surveillance of this villa, and also investigate whether there are any surveillance cameras or listening devices installed in this villa."

"Okay, Master. There are a total of 8 surveillance cameras around this villa, which can observe the exterior of the villa without blind spots.

As for the interior of the villa, after checking, no abnormal network information flow was found, so it can be determined that there are no surveillance cameras or listening devices."

"Hmm, that's not bad."

"Second, help me investigate Liu Yuting. Although I trust her very much, I can't rule out the possibility that she is a spy planted by some Organization. It's better to be careful, otherwise, I won't even know how I died when the time comes."

"Okay, Master. Liu Yuting was born on January 1, 1998. She attended school from elementary to high school in Yong'an County, which is under her hometown Jiang City.

Her parents work at the water plant in Yong'an County. Their backgrounds can be confirmed as real and valid.

Liu Yuting graduated from the Foreign Language Department of Jiangcheng University in 2020 and is currently engaged in market operations at Zhi Gao Software Company."

"Okay, that's about it. Since there's no problem, that's fine, then I can rest assured.

I didn't expect that she is considered to be in the same year as me, and she also just graduated this year.

I didn't expect such a coincidence, but it's also quite good this way."

"Right. Third, report to me on the company's situation these past few days."

"Okay, Master. Zhi Gao Software Company currently has a total of 628 employees.

In the past few days since you left, the company has received interview requests from 13 TV stations, mostly about Zhi Gao Charity.

During your time at home, they have already spent the first batch of funds, several billion yuan, on building ten thousand Project Hope primary schools, which has been widely reported by many media outlets.

Therefore, some media outlets hope to interview relevant personnel on how to use the remaining 60 billion yuan.

However, since you were not present, the reception staff did not dare to make decisions on their own and refused all requests.

Also, currently, the number of downloads for the Smart Mutual Translation product is 117.67 million people, including 67.37 million people in China.

The number of paying users is 43.64 million people, with an average payment cycle of one and a half months. The daily usage frequency of paying users is generally low; they only use it when visiting specific websites or watching foreign videos, and they close the software or leave it running in the background at other times.

This indicates that although Smart Mutual Translation is very effective, its attractiveness and user activity are not sufficient."

"Hmm, I see, that's acceptable."

"Right. Fourth, have there been any spy incidents or theft incidents at the company these days?"

"Master, there have indeed been related incidents.

After investigation, foreign forces have begun to infiltrate the company's Technical Department and bribe some technical members.

However, those technical members could not access core secrets, so the information they provided was very unsatisfactory to the foreign forces.

Therefore, they launched a plan called 'Monkey Steals the Peach'.

However, the company has enough security personnel.

During the implementation of the plan, someone revealed a flaw under the surveillance camera and was discovered by me, so I activated the alarm.

After that, they were all caught by the security personnel.

Finally, the Police Officer came, and the security personnel handed over all these foreign personnel to the police for handling.

However, there has been no news since then. According to analysis, it is very likely that the relevant departments and the other party exchanged captured intelligence personnel."

"Hmm, as long as the company is fine, that's good.

However, for those who want to be traitors, give me a list, and I will fire them later.

And put these people on our company's blacklist, so that they can't enjoy our premium services and excellent products in the future. These people are too hateful."

"Okay, Master.

However, two of them were coerced, and the enemy threatened their families and friends.

They did not agree to lie low because of the temptation of money.

But they are still engaged in exploring and stealing the company's intelligence and scientific and technological data.

Do these people also need to be dealt with?"

"Hmm, that's a good question.

Forget it, these two will not be added to the blacklist. However, they still need to be dismissed without leniency, and at the same time, report this matter to the police, saying that we discovered it accidentally."

"Okay, Master. The list includes xxx respectively."

"Okay, that's about all for these matters."

"Okay, Master. Goodbye, Master."

As soon as the words fell, alpha's holographic projection disappeared without a trace.

After that, Li Bufan returned to the company, and the time was already 11 o'clock.

Li Bufan first went to the CEO's office to find Bu Changzhuo to see if he was working at the company.

Indeed, upon opening the door, Bu Changzhuo was sitting in front of the computer, typing on the keyboard.

He walked closer and took a look, finding that he was notifying the people in the charity department to accept media interviews. On the one hand, it was to accept public supervision, and on the other hand, it was to further enhance the company's reputation.

Seeing this, Li Bufan nodded, expressing his strong agreement with his decision.

Just as he finished typing the last Chinese character and pressed the enter key, Bu Changzhuo raised his head.

He was startled to suddenly see someone in front of him. Then he realized it was Li Bufan and finally relaxed.

"Brother, why did you come in without a sound?"

"Second Brother, didn't I think you hadn't come to the company yet?"

"Uh, how could that be? I came yesterday, and Wang Huadong also came.

But why didn't I see you yesterday? Also, did you go out alone last night?"

"Uh, this... Okay, I admit it.

In the past few days while you guys were away, I found a girlfriend.

Then, you know, hehe.

However, from now on, I plan to live with her. I'll give you back the house keys. I've already moved my things from my room this morning."

After saying that, Li Bufan handed the keys to the table.

"Brother, you're too fast! You didn't even wait for us single guys!

How did you meet sister-in-law? When are you going to introduce her to us?"

"Haha. Well, she's a company employee. I met her a few days ago on the way to the company cafeteria, and then we got together.

You want to see her? Sure, I've arranged to have lunch with her at noon. You and Wang Huadong come too. We'll eat at a restaurant."

"Hmm, tsk tsk... I didn't see this coming, actually using a hidden rule?

Haha, okay, let's have lunch together at noon and see what our sister-in-law looks like, who could actually charm the handsome Li."

"Uh, there's no hidden rule. It's clearly because she was charmed by my kingly aura, okay?

Honestly, she doesn't even know my identity in the company yet.

And she, like us, also graduated from Jiangcheng University this year, but she was in the Foreign Language Department."

"Oh, I see. That's quite good then."

"Alright then, that's settled. You go ahead and be busy, I'll go and tell Wang Huadong, and then we'll have lunch at the usual place at 12 o'clock.

You guys can order first, and I'll bring her over later."

"Okay."

After talking to Bu Changzhuo, Li Bufan turned around, left the CEO's office, closed the office door, and then walked towards the adjacent Secretarial Department.

This time, Li Bufan started knocking on the door, mainly because there were a few employees in the Secretarial Department besides Wang Huadong.

He still needed to maintain his image in front of these employees.

"Knock knock knock..."

"Who is it?"

"Is Wang Huadong there? It's Li Bufan."

"Oh, Brother, okay, I'm opening the door."

Subsequently, Li Bufan briefly explained the purpose of his visit, arranged to have lunch together at noon, and then left.

After that, Li Bufan washed his face slightly, tidied himself up a bit, and it was almost time to get off work.

At noon, Li Bufan first sent a message to Liu Yuting, asking her to wait for him at the company entrance, and he would drive her to the restaurant for lunch.

Then, Li Bufan went to the parking lot and drove the car to the company entrance.

At first, the security guard refused to let Li Bufan park at the entrance.

Li Bufan frowned, seemingly possessing a special aura that intimidated these security guards.

"Go find your Mr. Zhang and see if he dares to stop me."

So the security guard went to find Mr. Zhang, the head of the security guards.

The security guard was initially very puzzled about who was so undisciplined and intended to teach them a good lesson.

However, after seeing Li Bufan, he immediately backed down and then immediately reprimanded that security guard.

"This is our Chairman. Your high salary is paid by him. This entire company belongs to him, and you actually won't let him park."

"Ah, I'm sorry, Chairman, I'm new and wasn't aware, I apologize."

Li Bufan looked at the scene before him and didn't say much, just shook his head.

"It's alright. After all, you are just doing your duty, and I can understand.

How about this, Mr. Zhang, later on, see if there are any good positions and give him one. Let's consider it fate that we met."

Seeing Li Bufan being so generous, not only not blaming him but also giving him a little benefit, the security guard was instantly filled with gratitude and quickly bowed to express his thanks.

After a while, Liu Yuting arrived at the entrance, but she didn't see Li Bufan, only a Lamborghini supercar.

However, she wasn't sure if it was his and didn't dare to get in on her own, so she asked Li Bufan.

"Li Bufan, where are you? I'm at the company entrance."

"Let me see. Oh, I see you. That car is the one I'm driving, get in."

"Oh, okay, alright."

Upon arriving at the private room of the restaurant, Li Bufan and Liu Yuting took their seats.

Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong had already finished ordering and were drinking tea, looking at Li Bufan and Liu Yuting.

"Brother, is this sister-in-law?"

"Hehe, yes. Isn't she beautiful?"

"Yes, she is beautiful."

Liu Yuting, on the other hand, was very surprised, her heart restless.

Because when she joined the company, she specifically looked up the company's CEO and saw a picture of Bu Changzhuo.

However, at that time, she didn't notice that there was an even more important person in the company, the Chairman Li Bufan.

Seeing the company's CEO made her almost want to bow, but then she remembered that the company's CEO called her boyfriend Brother.

So what exactly was Li Bufan's identity? It seemed like he had said before that his position was a technical one, and his salary wasn't high either.

Could it be, could it be the legendary, most mysterious Chairman Mr. in the company, who is rarely seen?

My goodness, this surprise is too big.

Then, Liu Yuting looked at Li Bufan with a complex feeling, finding it difficult to speak.

Li Bufan noticed Liu Yuting's expression at this moment, thought for a moment, and understood that Liu Yuting seemed to have realized his identity.

Seeing this, Li Bufan no longer hesitated and spoke.

"Tingting, I didn't mean to hide it from you, I'm sorry.

Okay, I am the founder and Chairman of our Zhi Gao Software.

But don't worry, my heart for you will not change, my good darling."

"Hmm. Li Bufan, you're annoying, you're making me shy."

Then Liu Yuting raised her small fists and gently pounded on Li Bufan, but he wrapped his arms around her waist and held her in his embrace.

Liu Yuting also naturally lay in Li Bufan's arms, looking up at Li Bufan's handsome face, feeling very happy.

Seeing this, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong couldn't stand it anymore, feeling like they were being showered with affection.

"Cough cough... Pay attention, there are live audience members here."

Hearing this, Li Bufan released his arms around Liu Yuting, helped her up, and had her sit on the chair next to him, then looked at everyone.

"Cough cough... Are you guys envious? Haha, you can also find girlfriends.

There are so many female employees in the company, there must be one suitable for you, right?"

"Well... Let's talk about something else. This topic is too sad."

So, everyone shifted the topic to the company's products.

"Now the company's Smart Mutual Translation has reached a bottleneck. What should we do next?

Improve the functions of Smart Mutual Translation? Or release a new product?"

Bu Changzhuo looked at Li Bufan and asked in a deep voice.

Li Bufan thought for a moment, and for some reason, a series of images suddenly flashed through his mind.

There were scenes of giant ships and cannons in the star battlefield from "Star Wars," which was popular across the internet and appealed to both men and women, old and young.

There were also the unattainable black hole scenes from "Interstellar," which made people's heads hurt but were thought-provoking.

And there was the moment when the colossal planetary engine from the recently seen China science fiction film "wandering blue star" was ignited.

This gave Li Bufan a misconception, could it be that he should change industries, from internet software to film and television dramas?

The leap is too big, isn't it?

However, he thought of a commonality between software and movies, and that was the industrial engine for special effects production.

"Everyone, I suddenly have a good idea. As you know, the movie "wandering blue star" has been very popular in China recently.

I heard that the post-production special effects alone cost nearly 300 million yuan.

Furthermore, the box office revenue reached billions, resulting in a huge profit.

What are your thoughts on this?"

Bu Changzhuo was the first to speak.

"This movie is indeed good. I've seen it before.

But I really didn't know that the special effects cost so much money.

However, the box office is real; it's still the number one box office in China cinemas.

So, are you thinking of developing into the entertainment industry?"

Li Bufan nodded, then shook his head.

"Sort of, and not sort of.

My plan is to create a brand new, more perfect, and easy-to-use special effects software.

What do you think?"

"This idea is good. If it can be made, it will definitely make money.

But the question is, can the programmers in the company handle it?"

"Hehe, no problem.

Regarding technical matters, I know more than you do. If I say it's possible, it definitely is, don't worry."

"Okay, then. We'll look forward to your good news."

"Haha, good."

Just like that, everyone chatted and laughed, finished lunch, and returned to the company.

Li Bufan had some ideas for the company's next product, which was to create a more efficient special effects production software.
