Chapter 1:0: Moving into the Chairman's Office



At this moment, the delivery person had finished unloading, and boxes upon boxes of office supplies were stacked in the lobby on the first floor.

Li Bufan found Wang Huadong, who was supervising the delivery person.

"Third Brother, are all the various supplies I asked you to purchase and customize here?"

Wang Huadong nodded.

"That's right.

For some items, I paid fifty percent above the market price to have the businesses rush the production overnight.

See?

Some things were just finished and delivered this morning.

Brother, don't worry.

In a bit, we can check them, and if there are no issues, we can move the items upstairs and place them properly."

Li Bufan was very satisfied upon hearing Wang Huadong's confident words.

"That's excellent.

Let's go take a look then.

Oh, right, while we're at it, let's also call over the few employees who have already arrived.

Everyone can get acquainted, and we happen to need help; we can't have just the three of us busy ourselves, can we?"

So, Li Bufan took Wang Huadong to find Bu Changzhuo.

"Second Brother, how many people have arrived now?

And how many are still on their way?"

Bu Changzhuo saw Li Bufan arrive and immediately went to meet him.

"Twelve people have arrived now, and about eleven more are on their way and will be here soon."

"Oh, right, how did your talks with those investment companies go?"

Li Bufan was quite satisfied that over 10 people had already arrived.

"Ah, currently four investment companies have contacted me.

Among them, Goldman Sachs Capital was the most generous, willing to give us a valuation of 1 billion us dollars and wanted to buy 49% of the shares for 500 million us dollars, but I refused them.

Don't you think I'm foolish?

After all, we still have 51% of the shares, so why would I refuse so much money?"

At this moment, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong were truly surprised by such a large sum of money, but also very happy, as Li Bufan had told them that they also had the right to 1% of the share dividends, meaning the shares they held were already worth over 60 million rmb.

However, after hearing that Li Bufan had refused, they didn't quite understand, then nodded, and then shook their heads.

Li Bufan understood that they didn't understand why he didn't accept Goldman Sachs Capital's investment, and they also indicated that they would support his idea.

Li Bufan was very happy, very happy for the two good brothers who were willing to support him all along.

"Actually, we will have a large sum of money very soon.

Within about three days, our company will receive at least tens of billions in revenue.

I can't reveal it yet, but you'll know when the time comes.

Second Brother and Third Brother, you will also be billionaires then, wahaha."

When Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong heard "tens of billions", they couldn't help but swallow, feeling extremely envious.

But after hearing that they would also be billionaires in the future, they were extremely happy, their faces filled with brilliant smiles.

Seeing this, Li Bufan realized that they seemed quite satisfied with assets exceeding 100 million rmb, and couldn't help but shake his head, sighing inwardly that their vision was still too narrow, hoping they could slowly improve in the future.

So, Li Bufan painted a bigger picture for them.

"However, don't think that over 100 million is a lot.

Follow me, and I will make each and every one of you a person above others, among the top tier of people at the peak of the world's pyramid.

However, we still need to work hard, take it one step at a time, and it will happen one day."

At this moment, Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong realized that over 100 million was actually not that much, and thinking of the greater achievements they might have in the future, they were extremely excited and expressed their unwavering obedience to Brother Li Bufan's instructions.

Next, Li Bufan and the other two greeted the employees who had already arrived.

Li Bufan didn't say much either, only introducing himself as the CTO, leaving the rest for Bu Changzhuo, the CEO, to handle.

Afterwards, some people arrived one after another and joined the large group unboxing.

It wasn't until past 12 PM that everyone finished unboxing these boxes and basically arranged the items, but some equipment like computers hadn't been set up properly.

After all, it was already noon, and there was no rush for these few hours.

So, at Li Bufan's suggestion, Bu Changzhuo took everyone to a nearby restaurant for a delicious meal.

Since Li Bufan had informed Bu Changzhuo and Wang Huadong beforehand, asking them not to reveal his identity as the Chairman for the time being.

Therefore, during the meal, Li Bufan was very quiet, barely saying anything, just silently picking up food and eating.

After finishing the meal, it was almost 1:30 PM.

The group returned to the office, either starting to clean up, clear cardboard boxes, and organize the previous office supplies; or starting to find a seat they liked, turn on their computers, and use the company's products.

At this time, since the company had few employees, and the building had floors 2-5, a total of 4 floors, which could accommodate nearly 1000 ordinary employees.

Therefore, they were all very proactive and chose to work on the 2nd floor.

Li Bufan was very satisfied with how Bu Changzhuo had arranged their work in an orderly manner.

Although Li Bufan did not reveal his identity as the Chairman to everyone, the secretariat needed to know.

So, under Li Bufan's instructions, as the Officer of the Secretarial Department, Wang Huadong naturally knew, and thus told those few secretaries not to reveal Li Bufan's identity without permission.

In fact, Li Bufan's purpose for doing this was very simple.

Because, if everyone knew he was the Chairman and founder, then almost everyone in the company might grovel and be overly respectful towards him.

Although Li Bufan didn't dislike others looking up to him, if everyone was like this, he felt it wasn't very good.

As for why it wasn't good, he couldn't quite explain it.

Moreover, doing this had another benefit: with an identity that was almost on the same level, that is, as an employee.

While chatting with other employees, Li Bufan could inadvertently discern a person's character through their words and actions.

Time quickly reached 1:50 PM, Li Bufan took out his phone and saw someone asking in the recruitment group: "I have arrived at the building, but they won't let me in, saying I don't have a work pass.

What should I do?"

Li Bufan saw this point and thought that he seemed to have forgotten that there was a reception employee downstairs, who only recognized a few people from his side and the batch of newly hired employees.

So, Li Bufan called Wang Huadong and asked him to go downstairs to pick up the applicants until 2:05 PM.

Meanwhile, Li Bufan walked to the meeting room on the 2nd floor, opened the doors and windows for ventilation, turned on the lights, and sat in the main seat, quietly waiting.

Before long, programmer after programmer walked into the meeting room on the 2nd floor.

Seeing Li Bufan sitting in the main seat, their first reaction was that he was very young.

Afterwards, some of them showed disdain, some showed admiration, and some... infatuation?

What's going on?

Li Bufan saw the expressions of a few infatuated female programmers looking at him and twitched his mouth.

Around 2 PM, Li Bufan counted inwardly and found that there were already 41 people; everyone had arrived.

Then Li Bufan walked around, personally closing the doors and windows.

Observing their reactions.

At this point, Li Bufan could already end the interviews for a few people, because their expressions at this moment showed disdain for Li Bufan.

Li Bufan first asked them to each give a simple one-minute self-introduction.

Everyone introduced their programming specialties, achievements and certificates obtained, as well as their graduating universities and work experience.

At this moment, Li Bufan looked at one of the people sitting closest to him, who was the person with the mocking expression earlier.

"Xiao Zhang, hello.

Tell me, why did you come to apply for a job at our company?

Also, what are your advantages and disadvantages compared to others?"

"Of course, it's to find a job.

I just graduated with a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States and returned to China not long ago this year.

Previously, I mainly engaged in research on machine learning theory and have published over 10 papers.

I have also done some research on your company's products, and I believe that with my addition, the product can reach a higher level.

My disadvantage is mainly that I don't have much work experience, as I have been dedicated to scientific research."

At this moment, Li Bufan's impression of him was that he was the kind of person who looked down on others, but after all, he graduated with a PhD from a foreign university, so his degree was indeed quite good, but he wasn't sure about his real capabilities.

However, Li Bufan still didn't want to hire him, mainly because he had a look of disdain when he spoke, as if mocking his shallow knowledge, and it seemed like he felt the position of CTO was also within his easy reach.

Li Bufan strongly disliked this character trait of his.

So, Li Bufan nodded and looked at the others.

At this time, Li Bufan didn't plan to ask them one by one anymore, as it was too time-consuming, so he thought of a solution.

"Everyone, I know you are all very cooperative in coming today.

For this, I express my gratitude.

However, since it's an interview, there must be interview questions.

Due to the large number of people, I plan to use a written test method.

I have already prepared the questions, please wait for 5 minutes."

So, Li Bufan walked out of the meeting room door and asked Wang Huadong to help him print 42 copies of the test questions.

At the top of these test questions, it asks for basic personal information and contact details.

Afterwards, there are three questions.

Question 1, how do you view our company's products?

And our company itself?

Question 2: What do you think our company's current market value is? What can it reach in a year?

Question 3: To you, what is most important? Money, family affection, or promises?

Would you reveal company secrets for monetary bribes or if criminals kidnapped your family and threatened you?

Please answer this question truthfully and sincerely. This item will not be used as a standard for the interview assessment, but it may determine the degree to which you will have access to company secrets in the future. It will not affect normal promotions.

Five minutes later, Li Bufan held the printed test papers and distributed them one by one to the 41 applicants present.

"Alright, you all have the test papers. I'll say this here, you must fill them out truthfully. There are surveillance cameras above, which can distinguish whether you are lying based on your subtle facial movements and writing status.

Even if you fill in that money is the most important in the third item, it's not a problem. I would rather you be greedy for money than be dishonest.

Okay, that's it. You can start answering the questions. Don't whisper or plagiarize each other. Submit them in half an hour."

At this time, Li Bufan sat in the main seat, blocking the phone screen with his body so that the surveillance camera could not capture the content on the phone.

At this time, Li Bufan was using the alpha clone left behind earlier to contact alpha at home.

"alpha, start connecting to the main body."

"Okay."

"Master, what are you looking for me for? Huh, you seem to be sitting in the meeting room, are the others taking the test?"

"Haha, yes, I just missed you. Haha, getting back to the point, I want you to take full control of all the surveillance cameras in the entire company, as well as various network facilities, including all employee computers.

If someone is found to be exposing company secrets, do not stop them, tamper with the data, and create a Trojan horse for the person behind it.

Then, host the company's servers to prevent malicious attacks from hackers. Also, through surveillance, identify suspicious personnel in real-time. It's possible that some spies or mercenaries might have mixed in. You need to remind me in time.

In short, take my survival and safety as the primary goal, then the company's secrets and property safety as the secondary goal, and then the safety of each employee. Can these be done?"

"Don't worry, Master. Leave it to me."

"Okay, also, analyze it again to see if anyone is being duplicitous when answering the questions later and wants to fill them out against their true feelings."

"This is a bit difficult, because with only surveillance, there is no real-time physical data of those people, so it cannot be 100% accurate, but it can reach an accuracy rate of 98.6."

"Then it's better to kill a thousand by mistake than to let go of a single person who doesn't follow their true feelings."

"Understood."

29 minutes later, Li Bufan asked alpha by typing on his phone.

"alpha, according to your investigation, which people did not follow their true feelings?"

"According to the analysis, 8 people are 100% certain, 3 people are 95% certain, 4 people are 87% certain, and the rest are all below 50%. The names of these people are xxx, xxx..."

Li Bufan was very satisfied with such results. Then he put his phone in his pocket, stood up, clapped his hands, and attracted everyone's attention.

"Everyone, time is up. Put down your pens. Everyone can leave today. We will sort it out as soon as possible and announce the results in the group at the latest tonight.

To those who are about to receive an offer, I congratulate you and hope that you will be able to demonstrate your due value in the company in the future, contribute to the company, and the company will certainly treat you well.

To those who failed to get an offer, I want to say, sorry. You can try again, constantly improve yourselves, and try at other companies.

Alright, I wish you good luck. Everyone, please leave. You will get a response tonight.

Before you leave, I will give each person a 100 rmb red envelope as travel expenses for coming today to show my gratitude."

At this time, some people's expressions were happy, thinking they were very confident, and when they heard there were still travel expenses, they were very grateful.

While others' expressions were gloomy, afraid that their previous dishonest performance would be noticed by the surveillance.

After sending off this group of people, Li Bufan took photos and scanned these answer sheets one by one. Then, in a corner without surveillance, Li Bufan began to inquire alpha.

"alpha, briefly analyze these answer sheets, first eliminate the previous 15 people, and then see which of the remaining people are more suitable for our company."

"Yes, Master. After analysis, among the remaining 26 people, 85% believe that the company has great prospects. Most people believe that the company's current market value is around 100 million.

Only less than 5 people believe that the company's current market value is 10 billion. Among them, one person believes that the company's market value is priceless, and the existing products can cause a stir in the trillion-level market, and our company can dominate."

"Also, more than half of the people believe that family affection is the most important, and 30% of the people believe that money is the most important. And the last 20% of the people believe that promises are the most important.

Therefore, for company secrets, their choices are to leak secrets, to leak secrets, and not to leak secrets respectively."

"Hmm, interesting. Since there is one person with such foresight, I'm very curious who it is."

"This person is named Wang Zixu, 26 years old this year, a graduate student from California Institute of Technology, with one year of work experience.

His grades are not bad, and his previous work was mainly due to his opinions being inconsistent with his superiors, and he finally chose to resign.

Also, this person chose to focus on promises in the third point, and stated that he would not reveal company secrets."

"Oh? So excellent?! Not bad. It seems I've met a talent.

Later, I can consider letting him be the CTO and manage the Technical Department. I can transfer to the R&D department."

"How about this, you calculate it, first select the 5 people who will not reveal company secrets, then select 3 people with good conditions from those who value family affection, and finally add the 2 people with the best technical skills from the remaining 18 people as a whole. In this way, a team of 10 people will be built."

"Yes, Master. The selection has been completed, their names are... their personal information is... their choices in the answers are..."

Li Bufan looked at the information of these people and found that the stunned young man who had mocked MAX before was also among them.

He was a little speechless, so he had to ask alpha to choose another person to replace him. Just like that, the list of 10 people was freshly released.

Among them, that special young man was promoted by Li Bufan to be the leader of the technical team, and the rest were ordinary team members.

Then, Li Bufan thought about the wording, asked alpha to sort out the list, and then sent it to the group.

Suddenly, the group exploded.

"Didn't you say it was tonight? I'm still on the bus, caught off guard by the official announcement of the offer, hahaha!"

"I suspect there must be some inside story, otherwise how could I not have gotten an offer."

"Upstairs + 1"

"Upstairs + 2"

"I think you are just sour grapes. Although I didn't get an offer either, I believe the CTO's decision must be correct."

"Agreed, I want to know if the lie detection function that the CTO mentioned before actually exists. I'm very curious."

"Yes, that's right, we also want to know."

Li Bufan saw a group of people discussing in the group and noticed that someone wanted to know about the lie detection function.

So, Li Bufan ordered alpha to mark and annotate the subtle facial movements of those who lied before, and then sent it to the group.

"As expected, was it discovered after all? Alas, I should have answered the questions honestly."

"Oh my goodness, this is definitely black technology, isn't it? Haha, I am very honored to be able to join the company's Technical Department."

"666, I'm so envious of the person upstairs."

Li Bufan later created a separate group with the 10 people who passed, named Zhi Gao Software Technical Department.

......

In the afternoon, Li Bufan saw that these people had basically finished packing their things.

Thinking that he hadn't seen the Chairman's office yet, he was itching to go.

Li Bufan took the elevator directly to the 6th floor. The Chairman's office was in the middle.

Since the office doors were basically open now, Li Bufan gently turned the handle, and the door opened.

Li Bufan found that there was not much dust on the desktop, no clutter, and the floor was also very clean. It seemed that they had cleaned it before.

Li Bufan sat on the leather Boss chair, leaned back, and looked at the simply and elegantly decorated office, feeling very happy.

"This is my Chairman's office. World, here I come!"
